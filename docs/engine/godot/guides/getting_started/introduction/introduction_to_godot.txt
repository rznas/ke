Introduction to Godot
*********************

This article is here to help you figure out whether Godot might be a
good fit for you. We will introduce some broad features of the engine
to give you a feel for what you can achieve with it and answer
questions such as "what do I need to know to get started?".

This is by no means an exhaustive overview. We will introduce many
more features in this getting started series.


What is Godot?
==============

Godot is a general-purpose 2D and 3D game engine designed to support
all sorts of projects. You can use it to create games or applications
you can then release on desktop or mobile, as well as on the web.

You can also create console games with it, although you either need
strong programming skills or a developer to port the game for you.

Note:

  The Godot team can't provide an open source console export due to
  the licensing terms imposed by console manufacturers. Regardless of
  the engine you use, though, releasing games on consoles is always a
  lot of work. You can read more on that here: Console support in
  Godot.


What can the engine do?
=======================

Godot was initially developed in-house by an Argentinian game studio.
Its development started in 2001, and the engine was rewritten and
improved tremendously since its open source release in 2014.

Some examples of games created with Godot include Cassette Beasts,
PVKK, and Usagi Shima. As for applications, the open source pixel art
drawing program Pixelorama is powered by Godot, and so is the voxel
RPG creator RPG in a Box. You can find many more examples in the
Official Showcase.

How does it work and look?
==========================

Godot comes with a fully-fledged game editor with integrated tools to
answer the most common needs. It includes a code editor, an animation
editor, a tilemap editor, a shader editor, a debugger, a profiler, and
more.

The team strives to offer a feature-rich game editor with a consistent
user experience. While there is always room for improvement, the user
interface keeps getting refined.

Of course, if you prefer, you can work with external programs. We
officially support importing 3D scenes designed in Blender and
maintain plugins to code in VSCode and Emacs for GDScript and C#. We
also support Visual Studio for C# on Windows.

Programming languages
=====================

Let's talk about the available programming languages.

You can code your games using GDScript, a Godot-specific and tightly
integrated language with a lightweight syntax, or C#, which is popular
in the games industry. These are the two main scripting languages we
support.

With the GDExtension technology, you can also write gameplay or high-
performance algorithms in C++ or other languages without recompiling
the engine. You can use this technology to integrate third-party
libraries and other Software Development Kits (SDK) in the engine.

Of course, you can also directly add modules and features to the
engine, as it's completely free and open source.


What do I need to know to use Godot?
====================================

Godot is a feature-packed game engine. With its thousands of features,
there is a lot to learn. To make the most of it, you need good
programming foundations. While we try to make the engine accessible,
you will benefit a lot from knowing how to think like a programmer
first.

Godot relies on the object-oriented programming paradigm. Being
comfortable with concepts such as classes and objects will help you
code efficiently in it.

If you are entirely new to programming, GDQuest's *Learn GDScript From
Zero* is a free and open source interactive tutorial for absolute
beginners to learn to program with Godot's GDScript language. It is
available as a desktop application or in the browser.

We will provide you with more Godot-specific learning resources in
Learning new features.

In the next part, you will get an overview of the engine's essential
concepts.
