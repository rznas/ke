First look at Godot's interface
*******************************

This page will give you a brief overview of Godot's interface. We're
going to look at the different main screens and docks to help you
situate yourself.

  For a comprehensive breakdown of the editor's interface and how to
  use it, see the Editor manual.


The Project Manager
===================

When you launch Godot, the first window you see is the Project
Manager. In the default tab **Projects**, you can manage existing
projects, import or create new ones, and more.

[image]

At the top of the window, there is another tab named **Asset
Library**. The first time you go to this tab you'll see a "Go Online"
button. For privacy reasons, the Godot project manager does not access
the internet by default. To change this click the "Go Online" button.
You can change this option later in the settings.

Once your network mode is set to "online", you can search for demo
projects in the open source asset library, which includes many
projects developed by the community:

The Project Manager's settings can be opened using the **Settings**
menu:

From here, you can change the editor's language (default is the system
language), interface theme, display scale, network mode, and also the
directory naming convention.

  Manager.


First look at Godot's editor
============================

When you open a new or an existing project, the editor's interface
appears. Let's look at its main areas:

[image]

By default, along the window's top edge, it features **main menu** on
the left, **workspace** switching buttons in the center (active
workspace is highlighted), and **playtest** buttons and the **Movie
Maker Mode** toggle on the right:

[image]

Just below the workspace buttons, the opened scenes as tabs are seen.
The plus (+) button right next to the tabs will add a new scene to the
project. With the button on the far right, distraction-free mode can
be toggled, which maximizes or restores the **viewport**'s size by
hiding **docks** in the interface:

[image]

In the center, below the scene selector is the **viewport** with its
**toolbar** at the top, where you'll find different tools to move,
scale, or lock the scene's nodes (currently the 3D workspace is
active):

[image]

This toolbar changes based on the context and selected node. Here is
the 2D toolbar:

Below is the 3D one:

  To learn more on the 3D viewport and 3D in general, read
  Introduction to 3D.

On either side of the viewport sit the **docks**. And at the bottom of
the window lies the **bottom panel**.

Let's look at the docks. The **FileSystem** dock lists your project
files, including scripts, images, audio samples, and more:

The **Scene** dock lists the active scene's nodes:

The **Inspector** allows you to edit the properties of a selected
node:

  Docks can be customized. Read more on Moving and resizing docks.

The **bottom panel**, situated below the viewport, is the host for the
debug console, the animation editor, the audio mixer, and more. They
can take precious space, that's why they're folded by default:

[image]

When you click on one, it expands vertically. Below, you can see the
animation editor opened:

[image]

Bottom panels can also be shown or hidden using the shortcuts defined
in **Editor Settings > Shortcuts**, under the **Bottom Panels**
category.


The five main screens
=====================

There are five main screen buttons centered at the top of the editor:
2D, 3D, Script, Game and Asset Library.

You'll use the **2D screen** for all types of games. In addition to 2D
games, the 2D screen is where you'll build your interfaces.

[image]

In the **3D screen**, you can work with meshes, lights, and design
levels for 3D games.

[image]

Note:

  Read Introduction to 3D for more detail about the **3D main
  screen**.

The **Game screen** is where your project will appear when running it
from the editor. You can go through your project to test it, and pause
it and adjust it in real time. Note that this is for testing how
adjustments would work, any changes made here are not saved when the
game stops running.

[image]

The **Script screen** is a complete code editor with a debugger, rich
auto-completion, and built-in code reference.

[image]

Finally, the **Asset Library** is a library of free and open source
add-ons, scripts, and assets to use in your projects.

  You can learn more about the asset library in About the Asset
  Library.


Integrated class reference
==========================

Godot comes with a built-in class reference.

You can search for information about a class, method, property,
constant, or signal by any one of the following methods:

* Pressing "F1" (or "Opt + Space" on macOS, or "Fn + F1" for laptops
  with a "Fn" key) anywhere in the editor.

* Clicking the "Search Help" button in the top-right of the Script
  main screen.

* Clicking on the Help menu and Search Help.

* "Ctrl + Click" ("Cmd + Click" on macOS) on a class name, function
  name, or built-in variable in the script editor.

[image]

When you do any of these, a window pops up. Type to search for any
item. You can also use it to browse available objects and methods.

[image]

Double-click on an item to open the corresponding page in the script
main screen.

[image]

Alternatively,

* Clicking while pressing the "Ctrl" key on a class name, function
  name, or built-in variable in the script editor.

* Right-clicking on nodes and choosing **Open Documentation** or
  choosing **Lookup Symbol** for elements in script editor will
  directly open their documentation.
