Learn to code with GDScript
***************************

In Godot, you can write code using the GDScript and C# programming
languages.

If you are new to programming, we recommend starting with GDScript
because we designed it to be simpler than all-purpose languages like
C#. It will be both faster and easier to learn.

While GDScript is a language specific to Godot, the techniques you
will learn with it will apply to other programming languages.

Note that it is completely normal for a programmer to learn and use
multiple languages. Programming languages have more similarities than
differences, so once you know one, you can learn another much faster.
