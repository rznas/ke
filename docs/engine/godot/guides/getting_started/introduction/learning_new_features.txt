Learning new features
*********************

Godot is a feature-rich game engine. There is a lot to learn about it.
This page explains how you can use the online manual, built-in code
reference, and join online communities to learn new features and
techniques.


Making the most of this manual
==============================

What you are reading now is the user manual. It documents each of the
engine's concepts and available features. When learning a new topic,
you can start by browsing the corresponding section of this website.
The left menu allows you to explore broad topics while the search bar
will help you find more specific pages. If a page exists for a given
theme, it will often link to more related content.

The manual has a companion class reference that explains each Godot
class's available functions and properties when programming. While the
manual covers general features, concepts, and how to use the editor,
the reference is all about using Godot's scripting API (Application
Programming Interface). You can access it both online and offline. We
recommend browsing the reference offline, from within the Godot
editor. To do so, go to Help -> Search Help or press "F1".

To browse it online, head to the manual's Class Reference section.

A class reference's page tells you:

1. Where the class exists in the inheritance hierarchy. You can click
   the top links to jump to parent classes and see the properties and
   methods a type inherits.

2. A summary of the class's role and use cases.

3. An explanation of the class's properties, methods, signals, enums,
   and constants.

4. Links to manual pages further detailing the class.

Note:

  If the manual or class reference is missing or has insufficient
  information, please open an Issue in the official godot-docs GitHub
  repository to report it.

You can hold "Ctrl" (macOS "Cmd") and then mouseover text like the
name of a class, property, method, signal, or constant to underline
it, then "Ctrl + Click" (macOS "Cmd + Click") it to jump to it.


Learning to think like a programmer
===================================

Teaching programming foundations and how to think like a game
developer is beyond the scope of Godot's documentation. If you're new
to programming, we recommend two excellent free resources to get you
started:

1. GDQuest's *Learn GDScript From Zero* is a free and open source
   interactive tutorial for absolute beginners to learn to program
   with Godot's GDScript language. It is available as a desktop
   application or in the browser.

2. If you prefer books, check out the free ebook Automate The Boring
   Stuff With Python by Al Sweigart.


Learning with the community
===========================

Godot has a growing community of users. If you're stuck on a problem
or need help to better understand how to achieve something, you can
ask other users for help on one of the many active communities.

The best place to ask questions and find already answered ones is the
official Godot Forum. These responses show up in search engine results
and get saved, allowing other users to benefit from discussions on the
platform. Once you have asked a question there, you can share its link
on other social platforms. Before asking a question, be sure to look
for existing answers that might solve your problem on this website or
using your preferred search engine.

Asking questions well and providing details will help others answer
you faster and better. When asking questions, we recommend including
the following information:

1. **Describe your goal**. You want to explain what you are trying to
   achieve design-wise. If you are having trouble figuring out how to
   make a solution work, there may be a different, easier solution
   that accomplishes the same goal.

2. If there is an error involved, **share the exact error message**.
   You can copy the exact error message in the editor's Debugger
   bottom panel by clicking the Copy Error icon. Knowing what it says
   can help community members better identify how you triggered the
   error.

3. If there is code involved, **share a code sample**. Other users
   won't be able to help you fix a problem without seeing your code.
   Share the code as text directly. To do so, you can copy and paste a
   short code snippet in a chat box, or use a website like Pastebin to
   share long files.

4. **Share a screenshot** of your *Scene* dock along with your written
   code. Most of the code you write affects nodes in your scenes. As a
   result, you should think of those scenes as part of your source
   code.

   Also, please don't take a picture with your phone, the low quality
   and screen reflections can make it hard to understand the image.
   Your operating system should have a built-in tool to take
   screenshots with the "PrtSc" (Print Screen) key (macOS: use "Cmd +
   Shift + 3" for a full screen shot, more information here).

   Alternatively, you can use a program like ShareX on Windows, or
   Flameshot on Windows/macOS/Linux.

5. Sharing a video of your running game can also be really **useful to
   troubleshoot your game**. You can use programs like OBS Studio and
   Screen to GIF to capture your screen.

   You can then use a service like streamable or a cloud provider to
   upload and share your videos for free.

6. If you're not using the stable version of Godot, please mention the
   version you're using. The answer can be different as available
   features and the interface evolve rapidly.

Following these guidelines will maximize your chances of getting the
answer you're looking for. They will save time both for you and the
persons helping you.


Community tutorials
===================

This manual aims to provide a comprehensive reference of Godot's
features. Aside from the 2D and 3D getting started series, it does not
contain tutorials to implement specific game genres. If you're looking
for a tutorial about creating a role-playing game, a platformer, or
other, please see Tutorials and resources, which lists content made by
the Godot community.
