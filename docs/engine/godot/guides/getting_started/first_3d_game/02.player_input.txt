Player scene and input actions
******************************

In the next two lessons, we will design the player scene, register
custom input actions, and code player movement. By the end, you'll
have a playable character that moves in eight directions.

Create a new scene by going to the **Scene** menu in the top-left and
clicking **New Scene**.

Click the **Other Node** button and select the "CharacterBody3D" node
type to create a CharacterBody3D as the root node.

[image]

Rename the CharacterBody3D to "Player". Character bodies are
complementary to the area and rigid bodies used in the 2D game
tutorial. Like rigid bodies, they can move and collide with the
environment, but instead of being controlled by the physics engine,
**you** dictate their movement. You will see how we use the node's
unique features when we code the jump and squash mechanics.

  To learn more about the different physics node types, see the
  Physics introduction.

For now, we're going to create a basic rig for our character's 3D
model. This will allow us to rotate the model later via code while it
plays an animation.

Add a Node3D node as a child of "Player". Select the "Player" node in
the **Scene** tree and click the "**+**" button to add a child node.
Rename it to "Pivot".

Then, in the FileSystem dock, expand the "art/" folder by double-
clicking it and drag and drop "player.glb" onto "Pivot".

[image]

This should instantiate the model as a child of "Pivot". You can
rename it to "Character".

[image]

Note:

  The ".glb" files contain 3D scene data based on the open source glTF
  2.0 specification. They're a modern and powerful alternative to a
  proprietary format like FBX, which Godot also supports. To produce
  these files, we designed the model in Blender 3D and exported it to
  glTF.

As with all kinds of physics nodes, we need a collision shape for our
character to collide with the environment. Select the "Player" node
again and add a child node CollisionShape3D. In the **Inspector**, on
the **Shape** property, add a new SphereShape3D.

[image]

The sphere's wireframe appears below the character.

[image]

It will be the shape the physics engine uses to collide with the
environment, so we want it to better fit the 3D model. Make it a bit
larger by dragging the orange dot in the viewport. My sphere has a
radius of about "0.8" meters.

Then, move the collision shape up so its bottom roughly aligns with
the grid's plane.

[image]

To make moving the shape easier, you can toggle the model's visibility
by clicking the **eye icon** next to the "Character" or the "Pivot"
nodes.

[image]

Save the scene as "player.tscn".

With the nodes ready, we can almost get coding. But first, we need to
define some input actions.


Creating input actions
======================

To move the character, we will listen to the player's input, like
pressing the arrow keys. In Godot, while we could write all the key
bindings in code, there's a powerful system that allows you to assign
a label to a set of keys and buttons. This simplifies our scripts and
makes them more readable.

This system is the Input Map. To access its editor, head to the
**Project** menu and select **Project Settings...**.

[image]

At the top, there are multiple tabs. Click on **Input Map**. This
window allows you to add new actions at the top; they are your labels.
In the bottom part, you can bind keys to these actions.

[image]

Godot projects come with some predefined actions designed for user
interface design (see above screenshot). These will become visible if
you enable the **Show Built-in Actions** toggle. We could use these
here, but instead we're defining our own to support gamepads. Leave
**Show Built-in Actions** disabled.

We're going to name our actions "move_left", "move_right",
"move_forward", "move_back", and "jump".

To add an action, write its name in the bar at the top and press Enter
or click the **Add** button.

[image]

Create the following five actions:

[image]

To bind a key or button to an action, click the "**+**" button to its
right. Do this for "move_left". Press the left arrow key and click
**OK**.

[image]

Bind also the "A" key, onto the action "move_left".

[image]

Let's now add support for a gamepad's left joystick. Click the "**+**"
button again but this time, select the input within the input tree
yourself. Select the negative X axis of the left joystick under
**Joypad Axes**.

[image]

Leave the other values as default and press **OK**.

Note:

  If you want controllers to have different input actions, you should
  use the Devices option in Additional Options. Device 0 corresponds
  to the first plugged gamepad, Device 1 corresponds to the second
  plugged gamepad, and so on.

Do the same for the other input actions. For example, bind the right
arrow, D, and the left joystick's positive axis to "move_right". After
binding all keys, your interface should look like this.

[image]

The final action to set up is the "jump" action. Bind the Space key
and the gamepad's A button located under **Joypad Buttons**.

[image]

Your jump input action should look like this.

[image]

That's all the actions we need for this game. You can use this menu to
label any groups of keys and buttons in your projects.

In the next part, we'll code and test the player's movement.
