Setting up the game area
************************

In this first part, we're going to set up the game area. Let's get
started by importing the start assets and setting up the game scene.

We've prepared a Godot project with the 3D models and sounds we'll use
for this tutorial, linked in the index page. If you haven't done so
yet, you can download the archive here: Squash the Creeps assets.

Once you downloaded it, extract the .zip archive on your computer.
Open the Godot Project Manager and click the *Import* button.

[image]

In the import popup, enter the full path to the freshly created
directory "3d_squash_the_creeps_starter/". You can click the *Browse*
button on the right to open a file browser and navigate to the
"project.godot" file the folder contains.

[image]

Click *Import* to open the project in the editor.

[image]

A window notifying you that the project was generated by an older
Godot version may appear. Click *OK* to convert the project to your
current Godot version.

[image]

If it doesn't open immediately open the project from your project
list.

The start project contains an icon and two folders: "art/" and
"fonts/". There, you will find the art assets and music we'll use in
the game.

[image]

There are two 3D models, "player.glb" and "mob.glb", some materials
that belong to these models, and a music track.


Setting up the playable area
============================

We're going to create our main scene with a plain Node as its root. In
the *Scene* dock, click the *Add Child Node* button represented by a
"+" icon in the top-left and double-click on *Node*. Name the node
"Main". An alternate method to rename the node is to right-click on
*Node* and choose *Rename* (or "F2"). Alternatively, to add a node to
the scene, you can press "Ctrl + A" ("Cmd + A" on macOS).

[image]

Save the scene as "main.tscn" by pressing "Ctrl + S" ("Cmd + S" on
macOS).

We'll start by adding a floor that'll prevent the characters from
falling. To create static colliders like the floor, walls, or
ceilings, you can use StaticBody3D nodes. They require
CollisionShape3D child nodes to define the collision area. With the
"Main" node selected, add a StaticBody3D node, then a
CollisionShape3D. Rename the StaticBody3D to "Ground".

[image]

Your scene tree should look like this

[image]

A warning sign next to the CollisionShape3D appears because we haven't
defined its shape. If you click the icon, a popup appears to give you
more information.

[image]

To create a shape, select the CollisionShape3D node, head to the
*Inspector* and click the *<empty>* field next to the *Shape*
property. Create a new *BoxShape3D*.

[image]

The box shape is perfect for flat ground and walls. Its thickness
makes it reliable to block even fast-moving objects.

A box's wireframe appears in the viewport with three orange dots. You
can click and drag these to edit the shape's extents interactively. We
can also precisely set the size in the inspector. Click on the
BoxShape3D to expand the resource. Set its *Size* to "60" on the
X-axis, "2" for the Y-axis, and "60" for the Z-axis.

[image]

Collision shapes are invisible. We need to add a visual floor that
goes along with it. Select the "Ground" node and add a MeshInstance3D
as its child.

[image]

In the *Inspector*, click on the field next to *Mesh* and create a
BoxMesh resource to create a visible box.

[image]

Once again, it's too small by default. Click the box icon to expand
the resource and set its *Size* to "60", "2", and "60".

[image]

You should see a wide grey slab that covers the grid and blue and red
axes in the viewport.

We're going to move the ground down so we can see the floor grid. To
do this, the grid snapping feature can be used. Grid snapping can be
activated 2 ways in the 3D editor. The first is by pressing the *Use
Snap* button (or pressing the "Y" key). The second is by selecting a
node, dragging a handle on the gizmo **then** holding "Ctrl" while
still clicking to enable snapping as long as "Ctrl" is held.

[image]

Start by setting snapping with your preferred method. Then move the
"Ground" node using the Y-axis (the green arrow on the gizmo).

[image]

Note:

  If you can't see the 3D object manipulator like on the image above,
  ensure the *Select Mode* is active in the toolbar above the view.

[image]

Move the ground down "1" meter, in order to have a visible editor
grid. A label in the bottom-left corner of the viewport tells you how
much you're translating the node.

[image]

Note:

  Moving the *Ground* node down moves both children along with it.
  Ensure you move the *Ground* node, **not** the *MeshInstance3D* or
  the *CollisionShape3D*.

Ultimately, "Ground"'s transform.position.y should be -1

[image]

Let's add a directional light so our scene isn't all grey. Select the
"Main" node and add a child node DirectionalLight3D.

[image]

We need to move and rotate the DirectionalLight3D node. Move it up by
clicking and dragging on the manipulator's green arrow and click and
drag on the red arc to rotate it around the X-axis, until the ground
is lit.

In the *Inspector*, turn on *Shadow* by clicking the checkbox.

[image]

At this point, your project should look like this.

[image]

That's our starting point. In the next part, we will work on the
player scene and base movement.
