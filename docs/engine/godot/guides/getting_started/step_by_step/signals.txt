Using signals
*************

In this lesson, we will look at signals. They are messages that nodes
emit when something specific happens to them, like a button being
pressed. Other nodes can connect to that signal and call a function
when the event occurs.

Signals are a delegation mechanism built into Godot that allows one
game object to react to a change in another without them referencing
one another. Using signals limits coupling and keeps your code
flexible.

For example, you might have a life bar on the screen that represents
the player's health. When the player takes damage or uses a healing
potion, you want the bar to reflect the change. To do so, in Godot,
you would use signals.

Like methods (Callable), signals are a first-class type since Godot
4.0. This means you can pass them around as method arguments directly
without having to pass them as strings, which allows for better
autocompletion and is less error-prone. See the Signal class reference
for a list of what you can do with the Signal type directly.

See also:

  As mentioned in the introduction, signals are Godot's version of the
  observer pattern. You can learn more about it in Game Programming
  Patterns.

We will now use a signal to make our Godot icon from the previous
lesson (Listening to player input) move and stop by pressing a button.

Note:

  For this project, we will be following the Godot naming conventions.

  * **GDScript**: Classes (nodes) use PascalCase, variables and
    functions use snake_case, and constants use ALL_CAPS (See GDScript
    style guide).

  * **C#**: Classes, export variables and methods use PascalCase,
    private fields use _camelCase, local variables and parameters use
    camelCase (See C# style guide). Be careful to type the method
    names precisely when connecting signals.


Scene setup
===========

To add a button to our game, we will create a new scene which will
include both a Button and the "sprite_2d.tscn" scene we created in the
Creating your first script lesson.

Create a new scene by going to the menu Scene > New Scene.

[image]

In the Scene dock, click the 2D Scene button. This will add a Node2D
as our root.

[image]

In the FileSystem dock, click and drag the "sprite_2d.tscn" file you
saved previously onto the Node2D to instantiate it.

[image]

We want to add another node as a sibling of the Sprite2D. To do so,
right-click on Node2D and select Add Child Node.

[image]

Search for the Button node and add it.

[image]

The node is small by default. Click and drag on the bottom-right
handle of the Button in the viewport to resize it.

[image]

If you don't see the handles, ensure the select tool is active in the
toolbar.

[image]

Click and drag on the button itself to move it closer to the sprite.

You can also write a label on the Button by editing its Text property
in the Inspector. Enter "Toggle motion".

[image]

Your scene tree and viewport should look like this.

[image]

Save your newly created scene as "node_2d.tscn", if you haven't
already. You can then run it with "F6" ("Cmd + R" on macOS). At the
moment, the button will be visible, but nothing will happen if you
press it.


Connecting a signal in the editor
=================================

Here, we want to connect the Button's "pressed" signal to our
Sprite2D, and we want to call a new function that will toggle its
motion on and off. We need to have a script attached to the Sprite2D
node, which we do from the previous lesson.

You can connect signals in the Node dock. Select the Button node and,
on the right side of the editor, click on the tab named Node next to
the Inspector.

[image]

The dock displays a list of signals available on the selected node.

[image]

Double-click the "pressed" signal to open the node connection window.

[image]

There, you can connect the signal to the Sprite2D node. The node needs
a receiver method, a function that Godot will call when the Button
emits the signal. The editor generates one for you. By convention, we
name these callback methods "_on_node_name_signal_name". Here, it'll
be "_on_button_pressed".

Note:

  When connecting signals via the editor's Node dock, you can use two
  modes. The simple one only allows you to connect to nodes that have
  a script attached to them and creates a new callback function on
  them.[image]The advanced view lets you connect to any node and any
  built-in function, add arguments to the callback, and set options.
  You can toggle the mode in the window's bottom-right by clicking the
  Advanced button.

Note:

  If you are using an external editor (such as VS Code), this
  automatic code generation might not work. In this case, you need to
  connect the signal via code as explained in the next section.

Click the Connect button to complete the signal connection and jump to
the Script workspace. You should see the new method with a connection
icon in the left margin.

[image]

If you click the icon, a window pops up and displays information about
the connection. This feature is only available when connecting nodes
in the editor.

[image]

Let's replace the line with the "pass" keyword with code that'll
toggle the node's motion.

Our Sprite2D moves thanks to code in the "_process()" function. Godot
provides a method to toggle processing on and off: Node.set_process().
Another method of the Node class, "is_processing()", returns "true" if
idle processing is active. We can use the "not" keyword to invert the
value.

GDScript

   func _on_button_pressed():
       set_process(not is_processing())

C#

   // We also specified this function name in PascalCase in the editor's connection window.
   private void OnButtonPressed()
   {
       SetProcess(!IsProcessing());
   }

This function will toggle processing and, in turn, the icon's motion
on and off upon pressing the button.

Before trying the game, we need to simplify our "_process()" function
to move the node automatically and not wait for user input. Replace it
with the following code, which we saw two lessons ago:

GDScript

   func _process(delta):
       rotation += angular_speed * delta
       var velocity = Vector2.UP.rotated(rotation) * speed
       position += velocity * delta

C#

   public override void _Process(double delta)
   {
       Rotation += _angularSpeed * (float)delta;
       var velocity = Vector2.Up.Rotated(Rotation) * _speed;
       Position += velocity * (float)delta;
   }

Your complete "sprite_2d.gd" code should look like the following.

GDScript

   extends Sprite2D

   var speed = 400
   var angular_speed = PI


   func _process(delta):
       rotation += angular_speed * delta
       var velocity = Vector2.UP.rotated(rotation) * speed
       position += velocity * delta


   func _on_button_pressed():
       set_process(not is_processing())

C#

   using Godot;

   public partial class MySprite2D : Sprite2D
   {
       private float _speed = 400;
       private float _angularSpeed = Mathf.Pi;

       public override void _Process(double delta)
       {
           Rotation += _angularSpeed * (float)delta;
           var velocity = Vector2.Up.Rotated(Rotation) * _speed;
           Position += velocity * (float)delta;
       }

       // We also specified this function name in PascalCase in the editor's connection window.
       private void OnButtonPressed()
       {
           SetProcess(!IsProcessing());
       }
   }

Run the current scene by pressing "F6" ("Cmd + R" on macOS), and click
the button to see the sprite start and stop.


Connecting a signal via code
============================

You can connect signals via code instead of using the editor. This is
necessary when you create nodes or instantiate scenes inside of a
script.

Let's use a different node here. Godot has a Timer node that's useful
to implement skill cooldown times, weapon reloading, and more.

Head back to the 2D workspace. You can either click the "2D" text at
the top of the window or press "Ctrl + F1" ("Ctrl + Cmd + 1" on
macOS).

In the Scene dock, right-click on the Sprite2D node and add a new
child node. Search for Timer and add the corresponding node. Your
scene should now look like this.

[image]

With the Timer node selected, go to the Inspector and enable the
Autostart property.

[image]

Click the script icon next to Sprite2D to jump back to the scripting
workspace.

[image]

We need to do two operations to connect the nodes via code:

1. Get a reference to the Timer from the Sprite2D.

2. Call the "connect()" method on the Timer's "timeout" signal.

Note:

  To connect to a signal via code, you need to call the "connect()"
  method of the signal you want to listen to. In this case, we want to
  listen to the Timer's "timeout" signal.

We want to connect the signal when the scene is instantiated, and we
can do that using the Node._ready() built-in function, which is called
automatically by the engine when a node is fully instantiated.

To get a reference to a node relative to the current one, we use the
method Node.get_node(). We can store the reference in a variable.

GDScript

   func _ready():
       var timer = get_node("Timer")

C#

   public override void _Ready()
   {
       var timer = GetNode<Timer>("Timer");
   }

The function "get_node()" looks at the Sprite2D's children and gets
nodes by their name. For example, if you renamed the Timer node to
"BlinkingTimer" in the editor, you would have to change the call to
"get_node("BlinkingTimer")".

We can now connect the Timer to the Sprite2D in the "_ready()"
function.

GDScript

   func _ready():
       var timer = get_node("Timer")
       timer.timeout.connect(_on_timer_timeout)

C#

   public override void _Ready()
   {
       var timer = GetNode<Timer>("Timer");
       timer.Timeout += OnTimerTimeout;
   }

The line reads like so: we connect the Timer's "timeout" signal to the
node to which the script is attached. When the Timer emits "timeout",
we want to call the function "_on_timer_timeout()", that we need to
define. Let's add it at the bottom of our script and use it to toggle
our sprite's visibility.

Note:

  By convention, we name these callback methods in GDScript as
  "_on_node_name_signal_name" and in C# as "OnNodeNameSignalName".
  Here, it'll be "_on_timer_timeout" for GDScript and OnTimerTimeout()
  for C#.

GDScript

   func _on_timer_timeout():
       visible = not visible

C#

   private void OnTimerTimeout()
   {
       Visible = !Visible;
   }

The "visible" property is a boolean that controls the visibility of
our node. The line "visible = not visible" toggles the value. If
"visible" is "true", it becomes "false", and vice-versa.

If you run the Node2D scene now, you will see that the sprite blinks
on and off, at one second intervals.


Complete script
===============

That's it for our little moving and blinking Godot icon demo! Here is
the complete "sprite_2d.gd" file for reference.

GDScript

   extends Sprite2D

   var speed = 400
   var angular_speed = PI


   func _ready():
       var timer = get_node("Timer")
       timer.timeout.connect(_on_timer_timeout)


   func _process(delta):
       rotation += angular_speed * delta
       var velocity = Vector2.UP.rotated(rotation) * speed
       position += velocity * delta


   func _on_button_pressed():
       set_process(not is_processing())


   func _on_timer_timeout():
       visible = not visible

C#

   using Godot;

   public partial class MySprite2D : Sprite2D
   {
       private float _speed = 400;
       private float _angularSpeed = Mathf.Pi;

       public override void _Ready()
       {
           var timer = GetNode<Timer>("Timer");
           timer.Timeout += OnTimerTimeout;
       }

       public override void _Process(double delta)
       {
           Rotation += _angularSpeed * (float)delta;
           var velocity = Vector2.Up.Rotated(Rotation) * _speed;
           Position += velocity * (float)delta;
       }

       // We also specified this function name in PascalCase in the editor's connection window.
       private void OnButtonPressed()
       {
           SetProcess(!IsProcessing());
       }

       private void OnTimerTimeout()
       {
           Visible = !Visible;
       }
   }


Custom signals
==============

Note:

  This section is a reference on how to define and use your own
  signals, and does not build upon the project created in previous
  lessons.

You can define custom signals in a script. Say, for example, that you
want to show a game over screen when the player's health reaches zero.
To do so, you could define a signal named "died" or "health_depleted"
when their health reaches 0.

GDScript

   extends Node2D

   signal health_depleted

   var health = 10

C#

   using Godot;

   public partial class MyNode2D : Node2D
   {
       [Signal]
       public delegate void HealthDepletedEventHandler();

       private int _health = 10;
   }

Note:

  As signals represent events that just occurred, we generally use an
  action verb in the past tense in their names.

Your signals work the same way as built-in ones: they appear in the
Node tab and you can connect to them like any other.

[image]

To emit a signal in your scripts, call "emit()" on the signal.

GDScript

   func take_damage(amount):
       health -= amount
       if health <= 0:
           health_depleted.emit()

C#

   public void TakeDamage(int amount)
   {
       _health -= amount;

       if (_health <= 0)
       {
           EmitSignal(SignalName.HealthDepleted);
       }
   }

A signal can optionally declare one or more arguments. Specify the
argument names between parentheses:

GDScript

   extends Node2D

   signal health_changed(old_value, new_value)

   var health = 10

C#

   using Godot;

   public partial class MyNode : Node
   {
       [Signal]
       public delegate void HealthChangedEventHandler(int oldValue, int newValue);

       private int _health = 10;
   }

Note:

  The signal arguments show up in the editor's node dock, and Godot
  can use them to generate callback functions for you. However, you
  can still emit any number of arguments when you emit signals. So
  it's up to you to emit the correct values.

To emit values along with the signal, add them as extra arguments to
the "emit()" function:

GDScript

   func take_damage(amount):
       var old_health = health
       health -= amount
       health_changed.emit(old_health, health)

C#

   public void TakeDamage(int amount)
   {
       int oldHealth = _health;
       _health -= amount;
       EmitSignal(SignalName.HealthChanged, oldHealth, _health);
   }


Summary
=======

Any node in Godot emits signals when something specific happens to
them, like a button being pressed. Other nodes can connect to
individual signals and react to selected events.

Signals have many uses. With them, you can react to a node entering or
exiting the game world, to a collision, to a character entering or
leaving an area, to an element of the interface changing size, and
much more.

For example, an Area2D representing a coin emits a "body_entered"
signal whenever the player's physics body enters its collision shape,
allowing you to know when the player collected it.

In the next section, Your first 2D game, you'll create a complete 2D
game and put everything you learned so far into practice.
