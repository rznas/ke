Nodes and Scenes
****************

In Overview of Godot's key concepts, we saw that a Godot game is a
tree of scenes and that each scene is a tree of nodes. In this lesson,
we explain a bit more about them. You will also create your first
scene.


Nodes
=====

**Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of your game**. They are
like the ingredients in a recipe. There are dozens of kinds that can
display an image, play a sound, represent a camera, and much more.

All nodes have the following characteristics:

* A name.

* Editable properties.

* They receive callbacks to update every frame.

* You can extend them with new properties and functions.

* You can add them to another node as a child.

The last characteristic is important. **Together, nodes form a tree**,
which is a powerful feature to organize projects. Since different
nodes have different functions, combining them produces more complex
behavior. As we saw before, you can build a playable character the
camera follows using a CharacterBody2D node, a Sprite2D node, a
Camera2D node, and a CollisionShape2D node.

Scenes
======

When you organize nodes in a tree, like our character, we call this
construct a scene. Once saved, scenes work like new node types in the
editor, where you can add them as a child of an existing node. In that
case, the instance of the scene appears as a single node with its
internals hidden.

Scenes allow you to structure your game's code however you want. You
can **compose nodes** to create custom and complex node types, like a
game character that runs and jumps, a life bar, a chest with which you
can interact, and more.

The Godot editor essentially is a **scene editor**. It has plenty of
tools for editing 2D and 3D scenes, as well as user interfaces. A
Godot project can contain as many of these scenes as you need. The
engine only requires one as your application's **main scene**. This is
the scene Godot will first load when you or a player runs the game.

On top of acting like nodes, scenes have the following
characteristics:

1. They always have one root node, like the "Player" in our example.

2. You can save them to your local drive and load them later.

3. You can create as many instances of a scene as you'd like. You
   could have five or ten characters in your game, created from your
   Character scene.


Creating your first scene
=========================

Let's create our first scene with a single node. To do so, you will
need to create a new project first. After opening the project, you
should see an empty editor.

[image]

In an empty scene, the Scene dock on the left shows several options to
add a root node quickly. 2D Scene adds a Node2D node, 3D Scene adds a
Node3D node, and User Interface adds a Control node. These presets are
here for convenience; they are not mandatory. Other Node lets you
select any node to be the root node. In an empty scene, Other Node is
equivalent to pressing the Add Child Node button at the top-left of
the Scene dock, which usually adds a new node as a child of the
currently selected node.

We're going to add a single Label node to our scene. Its function is
to draw text on the screen.

Press the Add Child Node button or Other Node to create a root node.

The Create New Node dialog opens, showing the long list of available
nodes.

[image]

Select the Label node. You can type its name to filter down the list.

[image]

Click on the Label node to select it and click the Create button at
the bottom of the window.

[image]

A lot happens when you add a scene's first node. The scene changes to
the 2D workspace because Label is a 2D node type. The Label appears,
selected, in the top-left corner of the viewport. The node appears in
the Scene dock on the left, and the node's properties appear in the
Inspector dock on the right.


Changing a node's properties
============================

The next step is to change the Label's Text property. Let's change it
to "Hello World".

Head to the Inspector dock on the right of the viewport. Click inside
the field below the Text property and type "Hello World".

[image]

You will see the text draw in the viewport as you type.

  You can edit any property listed in the Inspector as we did with the
  Text. For a complete reference of the Inspector dock, see Inspector
  Dock.

You can move your Label node in the viewport by selecting the move
tool in the toolbar.

[image]

With the Label selected, click and drag anywhere in the viewport to
move it to the center of the view delimited by the rectangle.

Running the scene
=================

Everything's ready to run the scene! Press the Run Current Scene
button in the top-right of the screen or press "F6" ("Cmd + R" on
macOS).

[image]

A popup invites you to save the scene, which is required to run it.
Click the Save button in the file browser to save it as "label.tscn".

[image]

Note:

  The Save Scene As dialog, like other file dialogs in the editor,
  only allows you to save files inside the project. The "res://" path
  at the top of the window represents the project's root directory and
  stands for "resource path". For more information about file paths in
  Godot, see File system.

The application should open in a new window and display the text
"Hello World".

[image]

Close the window or press "F8" ("Cmd + ." on macOS) to quit the
running scene.


Setting the main scene
======================

To run our test scene, we used the Run Current Scene button. Another
button next to it, Run Project, allows you to set and run the
project's **main scene**. You can also press "F5" ("Cmd + B" on macOS)
to do so.

[image]

Note:

  Running the project's *main scene* is distinct from running the
  *current scene*. If you encounter unexpected behavior, check to
  ensure you are running the correct scene.

A popup window appears and invites you to select the main scene.

[image]

Click the Select button, and in the file dialog that appears, double
click on "label.tscn".

[image]

The demo should run again. Moving forward, every time you run the
project, Godot will use this scene as a starting point.

Note:

  The editor saves the main scene's path in a project.godot file in
  your project's directory. While you can edit this text file directly
  to change project settings, you can also use the Project > Project
  Settings window to do so. For more information, see Project
  Settings.

In the next part, we will discuss another key concept in games and in
Godot: creating instances of a scene.
