Your first 2D game
******************

In this step-by-step tutorial series, you will create your first
complete 2D game with Godot. By the end of the series, you will have a
simple yet complete game of your own, like the image below.

You will learn how the Godot editor works, how to structure a project,
and build a 2D game.

Note:

  This project is an introduction to the Godot engine. It assumes that
  you have some programming experience already. If you're new to
  programming entirely, you should start here: Scripting languages.

The game is called "Dodge the Creeps!". Your character must move and
avoid the enemies for as long as possible.

You will learn to:

* Create a complete 2D game with the Godot editor.

* Structure a simple game project.

* Move the player character and change its sprite.

* Spawn random enemies.

* Count the score.

And more.

You'll find another series where you'll create a similar game but in
3D. We recommend you to start with this one, though.

**Why start with 2D?**

If you are new to game development or unfamiliar with Godot, we
recommend starting with 2D games. This will allow you to become
comfortable with both before tackling 3D games, which tend to be more
complicated.

You can find a completed version of this project at this location:

* Dodge the Creeps source code (GDScript)

* Dodge the Creeps source code (C#)


Prerequisites
=============

This step-by-step tutorial is intended for beginners who followed the
complete Step by step.

If you're an experienced programmer, you can find the complete demo's
source code here: Dodge the Creeps source code.

We prepared some game assets you'll need to download so we can jump
straight to the code.
