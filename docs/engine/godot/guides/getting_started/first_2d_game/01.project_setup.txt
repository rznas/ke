Setting up the project
**********************

In this short first part, we'll set up and organize the project.

Launch Godot and create a new project.

When creating the new project, you only need to choose a valid
*Project Path*. You can leave the other default settings alone.

GDScript

Download dodge_the_creeps_2d_assets.zip. The archive contains the
images and sounds you'll be using to make the game. Extract the
archive and move the "art/" and "fonts/" directories to your project's
directory.

C#

Download dodge_the_creeps_2d_assets.zip. The archive contains the
images and sounds you'll be using to make the game. Extract the
archive and move the "art/" and "fonts/" directories to your project's
directory.

Ensure that you have the required dependencies to use C# in Godot. You
need the latest stable .NET SDK, and an editor such as VS Code. See
Prerequisites.

C++

The C++ part of this tutorial wasn't rewritten for the new GDExtension
system yet.

Your project folder should look like this.

This game is designed for portrait mode, so we need to adjust the size
of the game window. Click on *Project -> Project Settings* to open the
project settings window, in the left column open the *Display ->
Window* tab. There, set "Viewport Width" to "480" and "Viewport
Height" to "720". You can see the "Project" menu on the upper left
corner.

Also, under the **Stretch** options, set **Mode** to "canvas_items"
and **Aspect** to "keep". This ensures that the game scales
consistently on different sized screens.

Organizing the project
======================

In this project, we will make 3 independent scenes: "Player", "Mob",
and "HUD", which we will combine into the game's "Main" scene.

In a larger project, it might be useful to create folders to hold the
various scenes and their scripts, but for this relatively small game,
you can save your scenes and scripts in the project's root folder,
identified by "res://". You can see your project folders in the
FileSystem dock in the lower left corner:

With the project in place, we're ready to design the player scene in
the next lesson.
