Godot includes a dedicated 2D renderer and 2D physics engine, as well
as 2D-specific features like tilemaps, particles, and animation
systems. This section covers most 2D-specific topics in Godot.

For 2D topics not covered in this section, see also 2D skeletons and
2D navigation overview. For using physics in 2D, see Physics. There is
also a step-by-step tutorial on creating a 2D game in Your first 2D
game.
