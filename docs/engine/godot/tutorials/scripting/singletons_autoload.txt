Singletons (Autoload)
*********************


Introduction
============

Godot's scene system, while powerful and flexible, has a drawback:
there is no method for storing information (e.g. a player's score or
inventory) that is needed by more than one scene.

It's possible to address this with some workarounds, but they come
with their own limitations:

* You can use a "master" scene that loads and unloads other scenes as
  its children. However, this means you can no longer run those scenes
  individually and expect them to work correctly.

* Information can be stored to disk in "user://" and then loaded by
  scenes that require it, but frequently saving and loading data is
  cumbersome and may be slow.

The Singleton pattern is a useful tool for solving the common use case
where you need to store persistent information between scenes. In our
case, it's possible to reuse the same scene or class for multiple
singletons as long as they have different names.

Using this concept, you can create objects that:

* Are always loaded, no matter which scene is currently running.

* Can store global variables such as player information.

* Can handle switching scenes and between-scene transitions.

* *Act* like a singleton, since GDScript does not support global
  variables by design.

Autoloading nodes and scripts can give us these characteristics.

Note:

  Godot won't make an Autoload a "true" singleton as per the singleton
  design pattern. It may still be instanced more than once by the user
  if desired.

Tip:

  If you're creating an autoload as part of an editor plugin, consider
  registering it automatically in the Project Settings when the plugin
  is enabled.


Autoload
========

You can create an Autoload to load a scene or a script that inherits
from Node.

Note:

  When autoloading a script, a Node will be created and the script
  will be attached to it. This node will be added to the root viewport
  before any other scenes are loaded.

[image]

To autoload a scene or script, start from the menu and navigate to
**Project > Project Settings > Globals > Autoload**.

[image]

Here you can add any number of scenes or scripts. Each entry in the
list requires a name, which is assigned as the node's "name" property.
The order of the entries as they are added to the global scene tree
can be manipulated using the up/down arrow keys. Like regular scenes,
the engine will read these nodes in top-to-bottom order.

[image]

If the **Enable** column is checked (which is the default), then the
singleton can be accessed directly in GDScript:

GDScript

   PlayerVariables.health -= 10

The **Enable** column has no effect in C# code. However, if the
singleton is a C# script, a similar effect can be achieved by
including a static property called "Instance" and assigning it in
"_Ready()":

C#

   public partial class PlayerVariables : Node
   {
       public static PlayerVariables Instance { get; private set; }

       public int Health { get; set; }

       public override void _Ready()
       {
           Instance = this;
       }
   }

This allows the singleton to be accessed from C# code without
"GetNode()" and without a typecast:

C#

   PlayerVariables.Instance.Health -= 10;

Note that autoload objects (scripts and/or scenes) are accessed just
like any other node in the scene tree. In fact, if you look at the
running scene tree, you'll see the autoloaded nodes appear:

Warning:

  Autoloads must **not** be removed using "free()" or "queue_free()"
  at runtime, or the engine will crash.


Custom scene switcher
=====================

This tutorial will demonstrate building a scene switcher using
autoloads. For basic scene switching, you can use the
SceneTree.change_scene_to_file() method (see Using SceneTree for
details). However, if you need more complex behavior when changing
scenes, this method provides more functionality.

To begin, download the template from here:
singleton_autoload_starter.zip and open it in Godot.

A window notifying you that the project was last opened in an older
Godot version may appear, that's not an issue. Click *Ok* to open the
project.

The project contains two scenes: "scene_1.tscn" and "scene_2.tscn".
Each scene contains a label displaying the scene name and a button
with its "pressed()" signal connected. When you run the project, it
starts in "scene_1.tscn". However, pressing the button does nothing.


Creating the script
-------------------

Open the **Script** window and create a new script called "global.gd".
Make sure it inherits from "Node":

[image]

The next step is to add this script to the autoload list. Starting
from the menu, open **Project > Project Settings > Globals >
Autoload** and select the script by clicking the browse button or
typing its path: "res://global.gd". Press **Add** to add it to the
autoload list and name it "Global", which is required for scripts to
access it by the name "Global":

[image]

Now whenever we run any scene in the project, this script will always
be loaded.

Returning to the script, it needs to fetch the current scene in the
*_ready()* function. Both the current scene (the one with the button)
and "global.gd" are children of root, but autoloaded nodes are always
first. This means that the last child of root is always the loaded
scene.

GDScript

   extends Node

   var current_scene = null

   func _ready():
       var root = get_tree().root
       # Using a negative index counts from the end, so this gets the last child node of `root`.
       current_scene = root.get_child(-1)

C#

   using Godot;

   public partial class Global : Node
   {
       public Node CurrentScene { get; set; }

       public override void _Ready()
       {
           Viewport root = GetTree().Root;
           // Using a negative index counts from the end, so this gets the last child node of `root`.
           CurrentScene = root.GetChild(-1);
       }
   }

Now we need a function for changing the scene. This function needs to
free the current scene and replace it with the requested one.

GDScript

   func goto_scene(path):
       # This function will usually be called from a signal callback,
       # or some other function in the current scene.
       # Deleting the current scene at this point is
       # a bad idea, because it may still be executing code.
       # This will result in a crash or unexpected behavior.

       # The solution is to defer the load to a later time, when
       # we can be sure that no code from the current scene is running:

       _deferred_goto_scene.call_deferred(path)


   func _deferred_goto_scene(path):
       # It is now safe to remove the current scene.
       current_scene.free()

       # Load the new scene.
       var s = ResourceLoader.load(path)

       # Instance the new scene.
       current_scene = s.instantiate()

       # Add it to the active scene, as child of root.
       get_tree().root.add_child(current_scene)

       # Optionally, to make it compatible with the SceneTree.change_scene_to_file() API.
       get_tree().current_scene = current_scene

C#

   public void GotoScene(string path)
   {
       // This function will usually be called from a signal callback,
       // or some other function from the current scene.
       // Deleting the current scene at this point is
       // a bad idea, because it may still be executing code.
       // This will result in a crash or unexpected behavior.

       // The solution is to defer the load to a later time, when
       // we can be sure that no code from the current scene is running:

       CallDeferred(MethodName.DeferredGotoScene, path);
   }

   public void DeferredGotoScene(string path)
   {
       // It is now safe to remove the current scene.
       CurrentScene.Free();

       // Load a new scene.
       var nextScene = GD.Load<PackedScene>(path);

       // Instance the new scene.
       CurrentScene = nextScene.Instantiate();

       // Add it to the active scene, as child of root.
       GetTree().Root.AddChild(CurrentScene);

       // Optionally, to make it compatible with the SceneTree.change_scene_to_file() API.
       GetTree().CurrentScene = CurrentScene;
   }

Using Object.call_deferred(), the second function will only run once
all code from the current scene has completed. Thus, the current scene
will not be removed while it is still being used (i.e. its code is
still running).

Finally, we need to fill the empty callback functions in the two
scenes:

GDScript

   # Add to 'scene_1.gd'.

   func _on_button_pressed():
       Global.goto_scene("res://scene_2.tscn")

C#

   // Add to 'Scene1.cs'.

   private void OnButtonPressed()
   {
       var global = GetNode<Global>("/root/Global");
       global.GotoScene("res://Scene2.tscn");
   }

and

GDScript

   # Add to 'scene_2.gd'.

   func _on_button_pressed():
       Global.goto_scene("res://scene_1.tscn")

C#

   // Add to 'Scene2.cs'.

   private void OnButtonPressed()
   {
       var global = GetNode<Global>("/root/Global");
       global.GotoScene("res://Scene1.tscn");
   }

Run the project and test that you can switch between scenes by
pressing the button.

Note:

  When scenes are small, the transition is instantaneous. However, if
  your scenes are more complex, they may take a noticeable amount of
  time to appear. To learn how to handle this, see the next tutorial:
  Background loading.Alternatively, if the loading time is relatively
  short (less than 3 seconds or so), you can display a "loading
  plaque" by showing some kind of 2D element just before changing the
  scene. You can then hide it just after the scene is changed. This
  can be used to indicate to the player that a scene is being loaded.
