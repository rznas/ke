Nodes and scene instances
*************************

This guide explains how to get nodes, create nodes, add them as a
child, and instantiate scenes from code.

  approach to scene instancing.


Getting nodes
=============

You can get a reference to a node by calling the Node.get_node()
method. For this to work, the child node must be present in the scene
tree. Getting it in the parent node's "_ready()" function guarantees
that.

If, for example,  you have a scene tree like this, and you want to get
a reference to the Sprite2D and Camera2D nodes to access them in your
script.

To do so, you can use the following code.

GDScript

   var sprite2d
   var camera2d

   func _ready():
       sprite2d = get_node("Sprite2D")
       camera2d = get_node("Camera2D")

C#

   private Sprite2D _sprite2D;
   private Camera2D _camera2D;

   public override void _Ready()
   {
       base._Ready();

       _sprite2D = GetNode<Sprite2D>("Sprite2D");
       _camera2D = GetNode<Camera2D>("Camera2D");
   }

Note that you get nodes using their name, not their type. Above,
"Sprite2D" and "Camera2D" are the nodes' names in the scene.

If you rename the Sprite2D node as Skin in the Scene dock, you have to
change the line that gets the node to "get_node("Skin")" in the
script.

Node paths
==========

When getting a reference to a node, you're not limited to getting a
direct child. The "get_node()" function supports paths, a bit like
when working with a file browser. Add a slash to separate nodes.

Take the following example scene, with the script attached to the
UserInterface node.

To get the AnimationPlayer node, you would use the following code.

GDScript

   var animation_player

   func _ready():
       animation_player = get_node("ShieldBar/AnimationPlayer")

C#

   private AnimationPlayer _animationPlayer;

   public override void _Ready()
   {
       base._Ready();

       _animationPlayer = GetNode<AnimationPlayer>("ShieldBar/AnimationPlayer");
   }

Note:

  As with file paths, you can use ".." to get a parent node. The best
  practice is to avoid doing that though not to break encapsulation.
  You can also start the path with a forward slash to make it
  absolute, in which case your topmost node would be "/root", the
  application's predefined root viewport.


Syntactic sugar
---------------

You can use two shorthands to shorten your code in GDScript. Firstly,
putting the "@onready" annotation before a member variable makes it
initialize right before the "_ready()" callback.

   @onready var sprite2d = get_node("Sprite2D")

There is also a short notation for "get_node()": the dollar sign, "$".
You place it before the name or path of the node you want to get.

   @onready var sprite2d = $Sprite2D
   @onready var animation_player = $ShieldBar/AnimationPlayer


Creating nodes
==============

To create a node from code, call its "new()" method like for any other
class-based datatype.

You can store the newly created node's reference in a variable and
call "add_child()" to add it as a child of the node to which you
attached the script.

GDScript

   var sprite2d

   func _ready():
       var sprite2d = Sprite2D.new() # Create a new Sprite2D.
       add_child(sprite2d) # Add it as a child of this node.

C#

   private Sprite2D _sprite2D;

   public override void _Ready()
   {
       base._Ready();

       _sprite2D = new Sprite2D(); // Create a new Sprite2D.
       AddChild(_sprite2D); // Add it as a child of this node.
   }

To delete a node and free it from memory, you can call its
"queue_free()" method. Doing so queues the node for deletion at the
end of the current frame after it has finished processing. At that
point, the engine removes the node from the scene and frees the object
in memory.

GDScript

   sprite2d.queue_free()

C#

   _sprite2D.QueueFree();

Before calling "sprite2d.queue_free()", the remote scene tree looks
like this.

[image]

After the engine freed the node, the remote scene tree doesn't display
the sprite anymore.

[image]

You can alternatively call "free()" to immediately destroy the node.
You should do this with care as any reference to it will instantly
become "null". We recommend using "queue_free()" unless you know what
you're doing.

When you free a node, it also frees all its children. Thanks to this,
to delete an entire branch of the scene tree, you only have to free
the topmost parent node.


Instancing scenes
=================

Scenes are templates from which you can create as many reproductions
as you'd like. This operation is called instancing, and doing it from
code happens in two steps:

1. Loading the scene from the local drive.

2. Creating an instance of the loaded PackedScene resource.

GDScript

   var scene = load("res://my_scene.tscn")

C#

   var scene = GD.Load<PackedScene>("res://MyScene.tscn");

Preloading the scene can improve the user's experience as the load
operation happens when the compiler reads the script and not at
runtime. This feature is only available with GDScript.

GDScript

   var scene = preload("res://my_scene.tscn")

At that point, "scene" is a packed scene resource, not a node. To
create the actual node, you need to call PackedScene.instantiate(). It
returns a tree of nodes that you can use as a child of your current
node.

GDScript

   var instance = scene.instantiate()
   add_child(instance)

C#

   var instance = scene.Instantiate();
   AddChild(instance);

The advantage of this two-step process is you can keep a packed scene
loaded and create new instances on the fly. For example, to quickly
instance several enemies or bullets.
