The GDExtension system
**********************

**GDExtension** is a Godot-specific technology that lets the engine
interact with native shared libraries at runtime. You can use it to
run native code without compiling it with the engine.

Note:

  GDExtension is *not* a scripting language and has no relation to
  GDScript.

This section describes how GDExtension works, and is generally aimed
at people wanting to make a GDExtension from scratch, for example to
create language bindings. If you want to use existing language
bindings, please refer to other articles instead, such as the articles
about C++ (godot-cpp) or one of the community-made ones.
