Other languages
***************

The Godot developers officially support the following languages for
Godot:

* GDScript (all versions)

* C# (.NET version)

* C++ (via GDExtension)

Note:

  There are no plans to support additional languages officially. That
  said, the community offers several bindings for other languages (see
  below).

The bindings below are developed and maintained by the community:

* D

* Go

* Nim

* Rust

* Swift

* Odin

Note:

  Not all bindings mentioned here may be production-ready. Make sure
  to research options thoroughly before starting a project with one of
  those. Also, double-check whether the binding is compatible with the
  Godot version you're using.
