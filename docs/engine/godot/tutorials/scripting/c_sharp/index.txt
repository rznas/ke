C#/.NET
*******

C# is a high-level programming language developed by Microsoft. Godot
supports C# as an option for a scripting language, alongside Godot's
own GDScript.

The standard Godot executable does not contain C# support out of the
box. Instead, to enable C# support for your project you need to
download a .NET version of the editor from the Godot website.

Godot API for C#
================

As a general purpose game engine Godot offers some high-level features
as a part of its API. Articles below explain how these features
integrate into C# and how C# API may be different from GDScript.

* C# signals

* C# exported properties

* C# global classes


C# platform support
===================

  See System requirements for hardware and software version
  requirements for the Godot engine.

Note:

  Since C# projects use the .NET runtime, also check the system
  requirements for the version of .NET that you'll be using. See
  supported OS.

Since Godot 4.2, projects written in C# support all desktop platforms
(Windows, Linux, and macOS), as well as Android and iOS.

Android support is currently experimental.

iOS support is currently experimental and has a few limitations.

* The official export templates for the iOS simulator only supports
  the "x64" architecture.

* Exporting to iOS can only be done from a MacOS device.

Currently, projects written in C# cannot be exported to the web
platform. To use C# on that platform, consider Godot 3 instead.
