C# global classes
*****************

Global classes (also known as named scripts) are types registered in
Godot's editor so they can be used more conveniently. In GDScript,
this is achieved using the "class_name" keyword at the top of a
script. This page describes how to achieve the same effect in C#.

* Global classes show up in the *Add Node* and *Create Resource*
  dialogs.

* If an exported property is a global class, the inspector restricts
  assignment, allowing only instances of that global class or any
  derived classes.

Global classes are registered with the "[GlobalClass]" attribute.

   using Godot;

   [GlobalClass]
   public partial class MyNode : Node
   {
   }

Warning:

  The file name must match the class name in **case-sensitive**
  fashion. For example, a global class named "MyNode" must have a file
  name of "MyNode.cs", not "myNode.cs".

The "MyNode" type will be registered as a global class with the same
name as the type's name.

The *Select a Node* window for the "MyNode" exported property filters
the list of nodes in the scene to match the assignment restriction.

   public partial class Main : Node
   {
       [Export]
       public MyNode MyNode { get; set; }
   }

If a custom type isn't registered as a global class, the assignment is
restricted to the Godot type the custom type is based on. For example,
inspector assignments to an export of the type "MySimpleSprite2D" are
restricted to "Sprite2D" and derived types.

   public partial class MySimpleSprite2D : Sprite2D
   {
   }

When combined with the "[GlobalClass]" attribute, the "[Icon]"
attribute allows providing a path to an icon to show when the class is
displayed in the editor.

   using Godot;

   [GlobalClass, Icon("res://Stats/StatsIcon.svg")]
   public partial class Stats : Resource
   {
       [Export]
       public int Strength { get; set; }

       [Export]
       public int Defense { get; set; }

       [Export]
       public int Speed { get; set; }
   }

[image]

The "Stats" class is a custom resource registered as a global class.
Exporting properties of the type "Stats" will only allow instances of
this resource type to be assigned, and the inspector will let you
create and load instances of this type easily.

Warning:

  The Godot editor will hide these custom classes with names that
  begin with the prefix "Editor" in the "Create New Node" or "Create
  New Scene" dialog windows. The classes are available for
  instantiation at runtime via their class names, but are
  automatically hidden by the editor windows along with the built-in
  editor nodes used by the Godot editor.
