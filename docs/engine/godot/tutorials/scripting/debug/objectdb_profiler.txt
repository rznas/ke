Using the ObjectDB profiler
***************************

Since Godot 4.6, there is a new **ObjectDB Profiler** tab in the
Debugger bottom panel. This profiler allows you to take snapshots of
the current state of the ObjectDB, which is the database that contains
all the Object-derived classes currently allocated in memory. This is
useful for identifying memory leaks and understanding the memory usage
of your project.

Additionally, this tool is able to visualize differences between two
snapshots. This can be used to identify improvements or regressions in
memory usage after making changes to your project. Reducing memory
usage can lead to better performance, even in cases where memory is
not a bottleneck. By reducing memory usage, you can perform fewer
allocations, which can be a costly operation, especially if performed
in large amounts during gameplay.

See also:

  See When and how to avoid using nodes for everything for information
  on using lighter-weight alternatives to nodes, which can help reduce
  memory usage in your project.

Warning:

  The ObjectDB profiler does **not** track every bit of memory used by
  the engine or by external libraries. Native engine classes that are
  not exposed to the scripting API will not appear in
  snapshots.Consider using external memory profiling tools if you need
  access to this information.


Usage
=====

Open the ObjectDB Profiler tab in the Debugger bottom panel. You will
land on the summary page with no snapshots taken yet.

   taken][image]ObjectDB profiler summary with no snapshots taken

Run the project, then get to a point where you'd like to take a
snapshot (for example, after loading a level). Click Take ObjectDB
Snapshot to take a snapshot at the current point in time. If the
button appears grayed out, make sure the project is running first.

   taken][image]ObjectDB profiler summary with one snapshot taken

You can take multiple snapshots during a single run of the project.
Also, you can right-click a snapshot in the snapshot list to rename
it, show it in the file manager, or delete it.

Tip:

  It's a good idea to rename snapshots after taking them to give them
  descriptive names (e.g., "before_optimization",
  "after_optimization"). Regardless of the name, the date at which the
  snapshot was taken remains saved in the snapshot file
  itself.Snapshot files have a ".odb_snapshot" extension and are
  located in "user://objectdb_snapshots/" (see Data paths details).
  These can safely be copied across devices, as they're platform-
  independent.


Viewing differences between snapshots
-------------------------------------

After taking at least two snapshots, the Diff Against dropdown becomes
available. Here, you can select another snapshot to compare the
currently selected snapshot with.

The summary page will then show the differences between the two
snapshots:

This also applies to every other tab in the ObjectDB profiler, which
will show the differences between the two snapshots in additional
columns.


Classes
-------

In the Classes tab, you can view how many instances of each class have
been created at the moment the snapshot was taken:

When in diff mode, it will show the class instance count for the
currently selected snapshot (column A) and the snapshot that is being
diffed against (column B). It will also show the difference in
instance count in the column Delta.

   column A is ``second_session``, column B is
   ``first_session``][image]Two snapshots being compared in the

   "first_session"

You can click on a class in the list on the right to view it in the
inspector.

Tip:

  Previewing instances in the inspector is also available in other
  tabs (Nodes, Objects, and RefCounted).


Objects
-------

The Objects tab is similar, but differs in the way it presents data.
Here, every instance is listed in a linear fashion, instead of
grouping them by class. When selecting an object, you will see a list
of other objects it references on the right (Outbound References), as
well as a list of objects it's being referenced by (Inbound
References).

This allows you to view objects either in a "top-down" manner (viewing
what objects a given object references) or in a "bottom-up" manner
(viewing what objects reference a given object).

   manner][image]The Objects tab being used to view objects in a "top-
   down" manner

In the above image, clicking the "default_font" object in the list
will switch the view to the perspective of that object. This object is
being referenced by a lot of other objects as well, which effectively
switches to a "bottom-up" perspective.

   manner][image]The Objects tab being used to view objects in a

Nodes
-----

Next, the Nodes tab shows the scene tree at the time the snapshot was
taken.

This tab is particularly interesting in diff view, since it supports
showing the difference between the two snapshots in a more visual
manner. When Combined Diff is unchecked, you can see the differences
side by side.

When Combined Diff is checked, you can see the differences merged into
a single tree, with added nodes highlighted in green and removed nodes
highlighted in red.

Additionally, you can view a list of orphan nodes (nodes that are not
attached to the scene tree root) at the end of the tree view. You can
view it more easily by collapsing the root node, since these are
listed outside the main scene tree.

   profiler][image]Orphan nodes at the end of the nodes tree in the

RefCounted
----------

The last tab is the RefCounted tab. This tab is similar to the Objects
tab, but it shows the reference counts of RefCounted-derived classes
directly in the table. The table has four columns:

* **Native Refs:** The number of native engine references to the
  object.

* **ObjectDB Refs:** The number of ObjectDB references to the object.

* **Total Refs:** The sum of native references and ObjectDB
  references.

* **ObjectDB Cycles:** The number of circular references detected.

When in diff view, snapshot B is always listed *above* snapshot A if a
RefCounted instance exists in both snapshots.

The list on the right shows details on the selected instance,
including a list of references and whether these are duplicates.

   instances][image]The RefCounted tab being used to view RefCounted

Note:

  The RefCounted tab does **not** list objects that derive directly
  from Object, as these don't use reference counting.
