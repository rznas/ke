Output panel
************

The output panel is found at the bottom of the screen. Click on
**Output** to open it.

The output panel provides several features to make viewing text
printed by the project (and editor) easier.

Note:

  The output panel automatically opens when running a project by
  default. You can control this behavior by changing the **Run >
  Bottom Panel > Action on Play** editor setting.


Message categories
==================

Four message categories are available:

* **Log:** Standard messages printed by the project. Displayed in
  white or black (depending on the editor theme).

* **Error:** Messages printed by the project or editor that indicate a
  failure of some kind. Displayed in red.

* **Warning:** Messages printed by the project or editor that report
  important information, but do not indicate a failure. Displayed in
  yellow.

* **Editor:** Messages printed by the editor, typically intended to be
  traces of undo/redo actions. Displayed in gray.


Filtering messages
==================

By clicking on the buttons on the right, you can hide certain message
categories. This can make it easier to find specific messages you're
looking for.

You can also filter messages by their text content using the **Filter
Messages** box at the bottom of the Output panel.


Clearing messages
=================

When running the project, existing messages are automatically cleared
by default. This is controlled by the **Run > Output > Always Clear
Output on Play** editor setting. Additionally, you can manually clear
messages by clicking the "cleaning brush" icon in the top-right corner
of the Output panel.


Printing messages
=================

Several methods are available to print messages:

* print(): Prints a message. This method accepts multiple arguments
  which are concatenated together upon printing. This method has
  variants that separate arguments with tabs and spaces respectively:
  printt() and prints().

* print_rich(): Same as "print()", but BBCode can be used to format
  the text that is printed (see below).

* push_error(): Prints an error message. When an error is printed in a
  running project, it's displayed in the **Debugger > Errors** tab
  instead.

* push_warning(): Prints a warning message. When a warning is printed
  in a running project, it's displayed in the **Debugger > Errors**
  tab instead.

For more complex use cases, these can be used:

* print_verbose(): Same as "print()", but only prints when verbose
  mode is enabled in the Project Settings or the project is run with
  the "--verbose" command line argument.

* printerr(): Same as "print()", but prints to the standard error
  stream instead of the standard output string. "push_error()" should
  be preferred in most cases.

* printraw(): Same as "print()", but prints without a blank line at
  the end. This is the only method that does **not** print to the
  editor Output panel. It prints to the standard output stream *only*,
  which means it's still included in file logging.

* print_stack(): Print a stack trace from the current location. Only
  supported when running from the editor, or when the project is
  exported in debug mode.

* print_tree(): Prints the scene tree relative to the current node.
  Useful for debugging node structures created at runtime.

* print_tree_pretty(): Same as "print_tree()", but with Unicode
  characters for a more tree-like appearance. This relies on box-
  drawing characters, so it may not render correctly with all fonts.

To get more advanced formatting capabilities, consider using GDScript
format strings along with the above printing functions.

  documentation.


Printing rich text
------------------

Using print_rich(), you can print rich text to the editor Output panel
and standard output (visible when the user runs the project from a
terminal). This works by converting the BBCode to ANSI escape codes
that the terminal understands.

In the editor output, all BBCode tags are recognized as usual. In the
terminal output, only a subset of BBCode tags will work, as documented
in the linked "print_rich()" method description above. In the
terminal, the colors will look different depending on the user's
theme, while colors in the editor will use the same colors as they
would in the project.

Note:

  ANSI escape code support varies across terminal emulators. The exact
  colors displayed in terminal output also depend on the terminal
  theme chosen by the user.
