Interpolation
*************

Interpolation is a common operation in graphics programming, which is
used to blend or transition between two values. Interpolation can also
be used to smooth movement, rotation, etc. It's good to become
familiar with it in order to expand your horizons as a game developer.

The basic idea is that you want to transition from A to B. A value
"t", represents the states in-between.

For example, if "t" is 0, then the state is A. If "t" is 1, then the
state is B. Anything in-between is an *interpolation*.

Between two real (floating-point) numbers, an interpolation can be
described as:

   interpolation = A * (1 - t) + B * t

And often simplified to:

   interpolation = A + (B - A) * t

The name of this type of interpolation, which transforms a value into
another at *constant speed* is *"linear"*. So, when you hear about
*Linear Interpolation*, you know they are referring to this formula.

There are other types of interpolations, which will not be covered
here. A recommended read afterwards is the Bezier page.


Vector interpolation
====================

Vector types (Vector2 and Vector3) can also be interpolated, they come
with handy functions to do it Vector2.lerp() and Vector3.lerp().

For cubic interpolation, there are also Vector2.cubic_interpolate()
and Vector3.cubic_interpolate(), which do a Bezier style
interpolation.

Here is example pseudo-code for going from point A to B using
interpolation:

GDScript

   var t = 0.0

   func _physics_process(delta):
       t += delta * 0.4

       $Sprite2D.position = $A.position.lerp($B.position, t)

C#

   private float _t = 0.0f;

   public override void _PhysicsProcess(double delta)
   {
       _t += (float)delta * 0.4f;

       Marker2D a = GetNode<Marker2D>("A");
       Marker2D b = GetNode<Marker2D>("B");
       Sprite2D sprite = GetNode<Sprite2D>("Sprite2D");

       sprite.Position = a.Position.Lerp(b.Position, _t);
   }

It will produce the following motion:

Transform interpolation
=======================

It is also possible to interpolate whole transforms (make sure they
have either uniform scale or, at least, the same non-uniform scale).
For this, the function Transform3D.interpolate_with() can be used.

Here is an example of transforming a monkey from Position1 to
Position2:

[image]

Using the following pseudocode:

GDScript

   var t = 0.0

   func _physics_process(delta):
       t += delta

       $Monkey.transform = $Position1.transform.interpolate_with($Position2.transform, t)

C#

   private float _t = 0.0f;

   public override void _PhysicsProcess(double delta)
   {
       _t += (float)delta;

       Marker3D p1 = GetNode<Marker3D>("Position1");
       Marker3D p2 = GetNode<Marker3D>("Position2");
       CSGMesh3D monkey = GetNode<CSGMesh3D>("Monkey");

       monkey.Transform = p1.Transform.InterpolateWith(p2.Transform, _t);
   }

And again, it will produce the following motion:

Smoothing motion
================

Interpolation can be used to smoothly follow a moving target value,
such as a position or a rotation. Each frame, "lerp()" moves the
current value towards the target value by a fixed percentage of the
remaining difference between the values. The current value will
smoothly move towards the target, slowing down as it gets closer. Here
is an example of a circle following the mouse using interpolation
smoothing:

GDScript

   const FOLLOW_SPEED = 4.0

   func _physics_process(delta):
       var mouse_pos = get_local_mouse_position()

       $Sprite2D.position = $Sprite2D.position.lerp(mouse_pos, delta * FOLLOW_SPEED)

C#

   private const float FollowSpeed = 4.0f;

   public override void _PhysicsProcess(double delta)
   {
       Vector2 mousePos = GetLocalMousePosition();

       Sprite2D sprite = GetNode<Sprite2D>("Sprite2D");

       sprite.Position = sprite.Position.Lerp(mousePos, (float)delta * FollowSpeed);
   }

Here is how it looks:

[image]

This is useful for smoothing camera movement, for allies following the
player (ensuring they stay within a certain range), and for many other
common game patterns.

Note:

  Despite using "delta", the formula used above is framerate-
  dependent, because the "weight" parameter of "lerp()" represents a
  *percentage* of the remaining difference in values, not an *absolute
  amount to change*. In "_physics_process()", this is usually fine
  because physics is expected to maintain a constant framerate, and
  therefore "delta" is expected to remain constant.For a framerate-
  independent version of interpolation smoothing that can also be used
  in "process()", use the following formula instead:

  GDScript

     const FOLLOW_SPEED = 4.0

     func _process(delta):
         var mouse_pos = get_local_mouse_position()
         var weight = 1 - exp(-FOLLOW_SPEED * delta)
         $Sprite2D.position = $Sprite2D.position.lerp(mouse_pos, weight)

  C#

     private const float FollowSpeed = 4.0f;

     public override void _Process(double delta)
     {
         Vector2 mousePos = GetLocalMousePosition();

         Sprite2D sprite = GetNode<Sprite2D>("Sprite2D");
         float weight = 1f - Mathf.Exp(-FollowSpeed * (float)delta);
         sprite.Position = sprite.Position.Lerp(mousePos, weight);
     }

  Deriving this formula is beyond the scope of this page. For an
  explanation, see Improved Lerp Smoothing or watch Lerp smoothing is
  broken.
