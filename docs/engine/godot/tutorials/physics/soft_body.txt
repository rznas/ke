Using SoftBody3D
****************

Soft bodies (or *soft-body dynamics*) simulate movement, changing
shape and other physical properties of deformable objects. For
example, this can be used to simulate cloth or to create more
realistic characters.


Physics engine considerations
=============================

Support for soft bodies is generally more robust in Jolt Physics
compared to GodotPhysics3D. You can switch physics engines by changing
**Physics > 3D > Physics Engine** in the Project Settings. Projects
created in Godot 4.6 and later use Jolt Physics by default, but
existing projects will have to be switched over manually.

Additionally, physics interpolation currently does not affect soft
bodies. If you want soft body simulation to look smoother at higher
framerates, you'll have to increase the **Physics > Common > Physics
Ticks per Second** project setting, which comes at a performance cost.


Basic setup
===========

A SoftBody3D node is used for soft body simulations. Unlike other
physics body nodes like RigidBody3D or StaticBody3D, it does **not**
have a CollisionShape3D or a MeshInstance3D child node. Instead, the
collision shape is derived from the mesh assigned to the node. This
mesh is also directly used for rendering, which means you don't need
to create any child nodes for a functional, visible setup.

We will create a bouncy cube to demonstrate the setup of a soft body.

Create a new scene with a Node3D node as root. Then, create a
SoftBody3D node. Add a BoxMesh in the **Mesh** property of the node in
the inspector and increase the subdivision of the mesh for simulation.

The subdivision level determines the precision level of the
deformation, with higher values allowing for smaller and more detailed
deformations, at the cost of performance. In this example, we'll set
it to 3 on each axis:

   inspector][image]Adjusting BoxMesh properties in the inspector

Now, set the parameters to obtain the type of soft body you aim for.
Try to keep the **Simulation Precision** above 5; otherwise, the soft
body may collapse.

   inspector][image]Adjusting SoftBody3D simulation properties in the
   inspector

Note:

  Handle some parameters with care, as some values can lead to strange
  results. For example, if the shape is not completely closed and you
  set pressure to a value greater than "0.0", the soft body will fly
  around like a plastic bag under strong wind.

Run the scene to view the simulation. Here's an example of what it
should look like:

Tip:

  To improve the simulation's result, increase the **Simulation
  Precision**. This can give a significant improvement at the cost of
  performance.Alternatively, you can increase the **Physics > Common >
  Physics Ticks per Second** project setting, which will also affect
  soft body simulation quality.


Cloak simulation
================

Let's make a cloak in the Platformer 3D demo.

Note:

  You can download the Platformer 3D demo on GitHub or the Asset
  Library.

Open the "player/player.tscn" scene, add a "SoftBody3D" node below the
root node, then assign a PlaneMesh resource to it in its **Mesh**
property.

Open the PlaneMesh's properties and set the size to "(0.5, 1.0)", then
set **Subdivide Width** and **Subdivide Depth** to "5". Adjust the
SoftBody3D node's position and rotation so that the plane appears to
be close to the character's back. You should end up with something
like this:

   back][image]Subdividing the PlaneMesh and placing it on the
   character's back

Tip:

  Subdivision generates a more tessellated mesh for better
  simulations. However, higher subdivision levels will impact
  performance. Try to find a balance between performance and quality.
  This depends on the number of soft body simulations that you expect
  to be active at a given time, as well as the distance between the
  camera and the soft body.

Add a BoneAttachment3D node under the skeleton node and select the
Neck bone to attach the cloak to the character skeleton.

Note:

  The BoneAttachment3D node is used to attach objects to a bone of an
  armature. The attached object will follow the bone's movement. For
  example, a character's held weapon can be attached this way.Do
  **not** move the SoftBody3D node under the BoneAttachment3D node as
  of now. Instead, we'll configure its *pinned points* to follow the
  BoneAttachment3D node.

   [image: Configuring the BoneAttachment3D node in the
   inspector][image]Configuring the BoneAttachment3D node in the
   inspector

To create pinned points, select the upper vertices in the SoftBody3D
node. A pinned point appears blue in the 3D editor viewport:

   [image: Pinning the SoftBody3D's points in the
   inspector][image]Pinning the SoftBody3D's points in the inspector

The pinned joints can be found in SoftBody3D's **Attachments**
section, which is under the **Collision** section that must be
expanded first. Choose the BoneAttachment3D node as the **Spatial
Attachment Path** for each pinned joint. The pinned joints are now
attached to the neck.

Tip:

  To assign the properties faster, you can drag-and-drop the
  BoneAttachment3D node from the scene tree dock to the **Spatial
  Attachment Path** property field.

Note that you may have to deselect then reselect the SoftBody3D node
for the **Attachments** section to appear.

   BoneAttachment3D node in the SoftBody3D
   inspector][image]Configuring pinned points to be attached to the
   BoneAttachment3D node in the SoftBody3D inspector

The last step is to avoid clipping by adding the CharacterBody3D
"Player" (the scene's root node) to the **Parent Collision Ignore**
property of the SoftBody3D.

Play the scene and the cloak should simulate correctly.

   scene][image]Final result when running the project's main scene

This covers the basic settings of a soft body simulation. Experiment
with the parameters to achieve the effect you are aiming for when
making your game.

Note:

  The cloak will not appear when viewed from certain angles due to
  backface culling. To resolve this, you can disable backface culling
  by assigning a new StandardMaterial3D, then setting its cull mode to
  **Disabled**. This will make the material render both sides of the
  plane.


Using imported meshes
=====================

The **Save to File** option in the Advanced Import Settings dialog
allows you to save a mesh to a standalone resource file that you can
then attach to SoftBody3D nodes.

You may also want to disable LOD generation or change the LOD
generation options when importing a mesh for use with SoftBody3D. The
default import settings will produce an LOD that merges adjacent faces
that are nearly flat with respect to each other, even at very close
render distances. This works well for static meshes, but is often
undesirable for use with SoftBody3D if you want these faces to be able
to bend and move with respect to each other, instead of being rendered
as a single plane.

See Import configuration and Mesh level of detail (LOD) for more
details.
