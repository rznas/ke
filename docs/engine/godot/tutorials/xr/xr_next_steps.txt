Where to go from here
*********************

Now that we have the basics covered there are several options to look
at for your XR game dev journey:

* You can take a look at the Advanced topics section.

* You can look at a number of XR demos here.

* You can find 3rd party tutorials on our Tutorials and resources
  page.


Godot OpenXR vendor plugin
==========================

The vendor plugin isn't just for deploying to Android. In the vendor
plugin, we implement many OpenXR vendor extensions that unlock unique
features on certain devices, or features that are new enough that a
standardized implementation is not available yet.

Together with the OpenXR working group we maintain a client support
matrix that lists all the OpenXR extensions Godot supports and whether
they require the vendor plugin.


XR Toolkits
===========

There are various XR toolkits available that implement more complex XR
logic ready for you to use. We have a small introduction to Godot XR
Tools that you can look at, a toolkit developed by core contributors
of Godot.

There are more toolkits available for Godot:

* Godot XR handtracking toolkit (GDScript)

* Godot XR Kit (GDScript)

* Godot XR Tools (GDScript)

* NXR (C#)
