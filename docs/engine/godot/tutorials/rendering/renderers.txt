Overview of renderers
*********************

See also:

  This page gives an overview of Godot's renderers, focusing on the
  differences between their rendering features. For more technical
  details on the renderers, see Internal rendering architecture.


Introduction
============

Godot 4 includes three renderers:

* **Forward+**. The most advanced renderer, suited for desktop
  platforms only. Used by default on desktop platforms. This renderer
  uses **Vulkan**, **Direct3D 12**, or **Metal** as the rendering
  driver, and it uses the **RenderingDevice** backend.

* **Mobile**. Fewer features, but renders simple scenes faster. Suited
  for mobile and desktop platforms. Used by default on mobile
  platforms. This renderer uses **Vulkan**, **Direct3D 12**, or
  **Metal** as the rendering driver, and it uses the
  **RenderingDevice** backend.

* **Compatibility**, sometimes called **GL Compatibility**. The least
  advanced renderer, suited for low-end desktop and mobile platforms.
  Used by default on the web platform. This renderer uses **OpenGL**
  as the rendering driver.


Renderers, rendering drivers, and RenderingDevice
-------------------------------------------------

   [image: Diagram of rendering layers. The Compatibility renderer
   runs on the OpenGL driver. The Forward+ and Mobile renderers run on
   RenderingDevice, which can use Vulkan, Direct3D 12, or Metal as a
   rendering driver.][image]Godot's rendering abstraction layers.

The *renderer*, or *rendering method*, determines which features are
available. Most of the time, this is the only thing you need to think
about. Godot's renderers are **Forward+**, **Mobile**, and
**Compatibility**.

The *rendering driver* tells the GPU what to do, using a graphics API.
Godot can use the **OpenGL**, **Vulkan**, **Direct3D 12**, and
**Metal** rendering drivers. Not every GPU supports every rendering
driver, and therefore not every GPU supports all renderers. Vulkan,
Direct3D 12, and Metal are modern, low-level graphics APIs, and
requires newer hardware. OpenGL is an older graphics API that runs on
most hardware.

RenderingDevice is a *rendering backend*, an abstraction layer between
the renderer and the rendering driver. It is used by the Forward+ and
Mobile renderers, and these renderers are sometimes called
"RenderingDevice-based renderers".


Choosing a renderer
===================

Choosing a renderer is a complex question, and depends on your
hardware and the which platforms you are developing for. As a starting
point:

Choose **Forward+** if:

   * You are developing for desktop.

   * You have relatively new hardware which supports Vulkan, Direct3D
     12, or Metal.

   * You are developing a 3D game.

   * You want to use the most advanced rendering features.

Choose **Mobile** if:

   * You are developing for newer mobile devices, desktop XR, or
     desktop.

   * You have relatively new hardware which supports Vulkan, Direct3D
     12, or Metal.

   * You are developing a 3D game.

   * You want to use advanced rendering features, subject to the
     limitations of mobile hardware.

Choose **Compatibility** if:

   * You are developing for older mobile devices, older desktop
     devices, or standalone XR. The Compatibility renderer supports
     the widest range of hardware.

   * You are developing for web. In this case, Compatibility is the
     only choice.

   * You have older hardware which does not support Vulkan. In this
     case, Compatibility is the only choice.

   * You are developing a 2D game, or a 3D game which does not need
     advanced rendering features.

   * You want the best performance possible on all devices and don't
     need advanced rendering features.

Keep in mind every game is unique, and this is only a starting point.
For example, you might choose to use the Compatibility renderer even
though you have the latest GPU, so you can support the widest range of
hardware. Or you might want to use the Forward+ renderer for a 2D
game, so you can advanced features like compute shaders.


Switching between renderers
---------------------------

In the editor, you can always switch between renderers by clicking on
the renderer name in the upper-right corner of the editor.

Switching between renderers may require some manual tweaks to your
scene, lighting, and environment, since each renderer is different. In
general, switching between the Mobile and Forward+ renderers will
require fewer adjustments than switching between the Compatibility
renderer and the Forward+ or Mobile renderers.

Since Godot 4.4, when using Forward+ or Mobile, if Vulkan is not
supported, the engine will fall back to Direct3D 12 and vice versa. If
the attempted fallback driver is not supported either, the engine will
then fall back to Compatibility when the RenderingDevice backend is
not supported. This allows the project to run anyway, but it may look
different than the intended appearance due to the more limited
renderer. This behavior can be disabled in the project settings by
unchecking Rendering > Rendering Device > Fallback to OpenGL 3.


Feature comparison
==================

This is not a complete list of the features of each renderer. If a
feature is not listed here, it is available in all renderers, though
it may be much faster on some renderers. For a list of *all* features
in Godot, see List of features.

Hardware with RenderingDevice support is hardware which can run
Vulkan, Direct3D 12, or Metal.
