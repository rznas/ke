Exporting for visionOS
**********************

See also:

  This page describes how to export a Godot project to visionOS. If
  you're looking to compile export template binaries from source
  instead, see Compiling for visionOS.

Exporting instructions for visionOS are currently identical to
Compiling for iOS, except you should add a **visionOS** export preset
instead of **iOS**. See the linked page for details.

Note:

  Note that currently, only exporting an application for use on a flat
  plane within the headset is supported. Immersive experiences are not
  supported.
