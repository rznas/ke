Running Godot apps on macOS
***************************

See also:

  This page covers running Godot projects on macOS. If you haven't
  exported your project yet, read Exporting for macOS first.

By default, macOS will run only applications that are signed and
notarized.

Note:

  When running an app from the Downloads folder or when still in
  quarantine, Gatekeeper will perform *path randomization* as a
  security measure. This breaks access to relative paths from the app,
  which the app relies upon to work. To resolve this issue, move the
  app to the "/Applications" folder.In general, macOS apps should
  avoid relying on relative paths from the application folder.

Depending on the way a macOS app is signed and distributed, the
following scenarios are possible:


App is signed, notarized and distributed via App Store
======================================================

Note:

  App developers need to join the Apple Developer Program, and
  configure signing and notarization options during export, then
  upload the app to the App Store.

The app should run out of the box, without extra user interaction
required.


App is signed, notarized and distributed outside App Store
==========================================================

Note:

  App developers need to join the Apple Developer Program, and
  configure signing and notarization options during export, then
  distribute the app as ".DMG" or ".ZIP" archive.

When you run the app for the first time, the following dialog is
displayed:

Click "Open" to start the app.

If you see the following warning dialog, your Mac is set up to allow
apps only from the App Store.

To allow third-party apps, open "System Preferences", click "Security
& Privacy", then click "General", unlock settings, and select "App
Store and identified developers".

App is signed (including ad-hoc signatures) but not notarized
=============================================================

Note:

  App developer used self-signed certificate or ad-hoc signing
  (default Godot behavior for exported project).

When you run the app for the first time, the following dialog is
displayed:

[image]

To run this app, you can temporarily override Gatekeeper:

* Either open "System Preferences", click "Security & Privacy", then
  click "General", and click "Open Anyway".

* Or, right-click (Control-click) on the app icon in the Finder window
  and select "Open" from the menu.

* Then click "Open" in the confirmation dialog.

* Enter your password if you're prompted.

Another option is to disable Gatekeeper entirely. Note that this does
decrease the security of your computer by allowing you to run any
software you want. To do this, run "sudo spctl --master-disable" in
the Terminal, enter your password, and then the **Anywhere** option
will be available:

Note that Gatekeeper will re-enable itself when macOS updates.


App is not signed, executable is linker-signed
==============================================

Note:

  App is built using official export templates, but it is not signed.

When you run the app for the first time, the following dialog is
displayed:

[image]

To run this app, you should remove the quarantine extended file
attribute manually:

* Open "Terminal.app" (press "Cmd + Space" and enter "Terminal").

* Navigate to the folder containing the target application.

  Use the "cd path_to_the_app_folder" command, e.g. "cd ~/Downloads/"
  if it's in the "Downloads" folder.

* Run the command "xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "Unsigned Game.app""
  (including quotation marks and ".app" extension).


Neither app nor executable is signed (relevant for Apple Silicon Macs only)
===========================================================================

Note:

  App is built using custom export templates, compiled using OSXCross,
  and it is not signed at all.

When you run the app for the first time, the following dialog is
displayed:

[image]

To run this app, you can ad-hoc sign it yourself:

* Install "Xcode" for the App Store, start it and confirm command line
  tools installation.

* Open "Terminal.app" (press "Cmd + Space" and enter "Terminal").

* Navigate to the folder containing the target application.

  Use the "cd path_to_the_app_folder" command, e.g. "cd ~/Downloads/"
  if it's in the "Downloads" folder.

* Run the following commands:

  "xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "Unsigned Game.app"" (including
  quotation marks and ".app" extension).

  "codesign -s - --force --deep "Unsigned Game.app"" (including
  quotation marks and ".app" extension).
