Gradle builds for Android
*************************

Godot provides the option to build using the gradle buildsystem.
Instead of using the already pre-built template that ships with Godot,
an Android Java project gets installed into your project folder. Godot
will then build it and use it as an export template every time you
export the project.

There are some reasons why you may want to do this:

* Modify the project before it's built.

* Add external SDKs that build with your project.

Configuring the gradle build is a fairly straightforward process. But
first you need to follow the steps in exporting for android up to
**Setting it up in Godot**. After doing that, follow the steps below.


Set up the gradle build environment
===================================

Go to the Project menu, and install the *Gradle Build* template:

Make sure export templates are downloaded. If not, this menu will help
you download them.

A Gradle-based Android project will be created under
"res://android/build". Editing these files is not needed unless you
really need to modify the project.


Enabling the gradle build and exporting
=======================================

When setting up the Android project in the **Project > Export**
dialog, **Gradle Build** needs to be enabled:

From now on, attempting to export the project or one-click deploy will
call the Gradle build system to generate fresh templates (this window
will appear every time):

The templates built will be used automatically afterwards, so no
further configuration is needed.

Note:

  When using the gradle Android build system, assets that are placed
  within a folder whose name begins with an underscore will not be
  included in the generated APK. This does not apply to assets whose
  *file* name begins with an underscore.For example,
  "_example/image.png" will **not** be included as an asset, but
  "_image.png" will.
