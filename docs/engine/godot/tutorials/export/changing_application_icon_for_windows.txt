Manually changing application icon for Windows
**********************************************

Windows applications use a Windows only format called ICO for their
file icon and taskbar icon. Since Godot 4.1, Godot can create an ICO
file for you based on the icon file defined in the Windows export
preset. Supported formats are PNG, WebP, and SVG. If no icon is
defined in the Windows export preset, the application/config/icon
project setting is used automatically instead.

This means you no longer need to follow the steps in this section to
manually create an ICO file, unless you wish to have control over the
icon design depending on its displayed size.


Creating a custom ICO file
==========================

You can create your application icon in any program but you will have
to convert it to an ICO file using a program such as GIMP.

This video tutorial goes over how to export an ICO file with GIMP.

It is also possible to convert a PNG image to an hiDPI-friendly ICO
file using this ImageMagick command:

   magick convert icon.png -define icon:auto-resize=256,128,64,48,32,16 icon.ico

Depending on which version of ImageMagick you installed, you might
need to leave out the "magick" and run this command instead:

   convert icon.png -define icon:auto-resize=256,128,64,48,32,16 icon.ico

Warning:

  For the ICO file to effectively replace the default Godot icon, it
  must contain *all* the sizes included in the default Godot icon:
  16×16, 32×32, 48×48, 64×64, 128×128, 256×256. If the ICO file does
  not contain all the sizes, the default Godot icon will be kept for
  the sizes that weren't overridden.The above ImageMagick command
  takes this into account.


Changing the taskbar icon
=========================

The taskbar icon is the icon that shows up on the taskbar when your
project is running.

To change the taskbar icon, go to **Project > Project Settings >
Application > Config**, make sure **Advanced Settings** are enabled to
see the setting, then go to "Windows Native Icon". Click on the folder
icon and select your ICO file.

This setting only changes the icon for your exported game on Windows.
To set the icon for macOS, use "Macos Native Icon". And for any other
platform, use the "Icon" setting.


Changing the file icon
======================

The file icon is the icon of the executable that you click on to start
the project.

[image]

To do that, you will need to specify the icon when exporting. Go to
**Project > Export**. Assuming you have already created a Windows
Desktop preset, select your icon in ICO format in the **Application >
Icon** field.

Testing the result
==================

You can now export the project. If it worked correctly, you should see
this:

Note:

  If your icon isn't showing up properly try clearing the icon cache.
  To do so, open the **Run** dialog and enter "ie4uinit.exe
  -ClearIconCache" or "ie4uinit.exe -show".
