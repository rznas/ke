Thread-safe APIs
****************


Threads
=======

Threads are used to balance processing power across CPUs and cores.
Godot supports multithreading, but not in the whole engine.

Below is a list of ways multithreading can be used in different areas
of Godot.


Global scope
============

Most Global Scope singletons are thread-safe by default. Accessing
servers from threads is supported. However, for the rendering and
physics servers, thread-safe operation must be enabled in the project
settings first.

This makes singletons ideal for code that creates dozens of thousands
of instances in servers and controls them from threads. Of course, it
requires a bit more code, as this is used directly and not within the
scene tree.


Scene tree
==========

Interacting with the active scene tree is **not** thread-safe. Make
sure to use mutexes when sending data between threads. If you want to
call functions or set properties from a thread, you may use
call_deferred or set_deferred:

GDScript

   # Unsafe:
   node.add_child(child_node)
   # Safe:
   node.add_child.call_deferred(child_node)

C#

   // Unsafe:
   node.AddChild(childNode);
   // Safe:
   node.CallDeferred(Node.MethodName.AddChild, childNode);

However, creating scene chunks (nodes in tree arrangement) outside the
active tree is fine. This way, parts of a scene can be built or
instantiated in a thread, then added in the main thread:

GDScript

   var enemy_scene = load("res://enemy_scene.scn")
   var enemy = enemy_scene.instantiate()
   enemy.add_child(weapon) # Set a weapon.
   world.add_child.call_deferred(enemy)

C#

   PackedScene enemyScene = GD.Load<PackedScene>("res://EnemyScene.scn");
   Node enemy = enemyScene.Instantiate<Node>();
   enemy.AddChild(weapon);
   world.CallDeferred(Node.MethodName.AddChild, enemy);

Still, this is only really useful if you have **one** thread loading
data. Attempting to load or create scene chunks from multiple threads
may work, but you risk resources (which are only loaded once in Godot)
being tweaked by the multiple threads, resulting in unexpected
behaviors or crashes.

Only use more than one thread to generate scene data if you *really*
know what you are doing and you are sure that a single resource is not
being used or set in multiple ones. Otherwise, you are safer just
using the servers API (which is fully thread-safe) directly and not
touching scene or resources.


Rendering
=========

Instancing nodes that render anything in 2D or 3D (such as Sprite2D or
MeshInstance3D) is *not* thread-safe by default. To run the rendering
driver on a separate thread, set the Rendering > Driver > Thread Model
project setting to **Separate**.

Note that the **Separate** thread model has several known bugs, so it
may not be usable in all scenarios.

Warning:

  You should avoid calling functions involving direct interaction with
  the GPU on other threads, such as creating new textures or modifying
  and retrieving image data. These operations can lead to performance
  stalls because they require synchronization with the
  RenderingServer, as data needs to be transmitted to or updated on
  the GPU.


Physics
=======

Physics simulation is *not* thread-safe by default. To run the physics
servers on separate threads (making them thread-safe), enable the
following project settings:

* **PhysicsServer2D:** Physics > 2D > Run on Separate Thread.

* **PhysicsServer3D:** Physics > 3D > Run on Separate Thread.


GDScript arrays and dictionaries
================================

In GDScript, reading and writing elements from multiple threads is OK,
but anything that changes the container size (resizing, adding, or
removing elements) requires locking a mutex.


Resources
=========

Modifying a unique resource from multiple threads is not supported.
However, handling references on multiple threads *is* supported. Hence
loading resources on a thread is as well - scenes, textures, meshes,
etc - can be loaded and manipulated on a thread and then added to the
active scene on the main thread. The limitation here is as described
above: one must be careful not to load the same resource from multiple
threads at once. Therefore, it's easiest to use **one** thread for
loading and modifying resources, and then the main thread for adding
them.
