Editor introduction
*******************

In this section, we cover the Godot editor in general, from its
interface to using it with the command line.


Editor's interface
==================

The following pages explain how to use the various windows,
workspaces, and docks that make up the Godot editor. We cover some
specific editors' interfaces in other sections where appropriate. For
example, the animation editor.

* Using the Project Manager

* Inspector Dock

* Project Settings

* Script Editor

* Default editor shortcuts

* Customizing the interface


XR editor
=========

Godot offers a port of the editor designed to run natively on Meta
Quest devices. The port can be downloaded from the Meta Horizon Store,
or from the Godot download page.

* Using the XR editor


Android editor
==============

Godot offers a native port of the editor running entirely on Android
devices. The Android port can be downloaded from the Android Downloads
page. While we strive for feature parity with the Desktop version of
the editor, the Android port has a certain amount of caveats you
should be aware of.

* Using the Android editor


Web editor
==========

Godot offers an HTML5 version of the editor running entirely in your
browser. No download is required to use it, but it has a certain
amount of caveats you should be aware of.

* Using the Web editor


Advanced features
=================

The articles below focus on advanced features useful for experienced
developers, such as calling Godot from the command line and using an
external text editor like Visual Studio Code or Emacs.

* Using an external text editor

* Using the engine compilation configuration editor


Managing editor features
========================

Godot allows you to remove features from the editor. This may be
useful if you're an educator trying to ease students into the editor
slowly, or if you're working on a project that's only 2D or only 3D
and don't want to see what you don't need.
