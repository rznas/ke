Using the engine compilation configuration editor
*************************************************

Godot comes with a large set of built-in features. While this is
convenient, this also means its binary size is larger than it could
be, especially for projects that only use a small portion of its
feature set.

To help reduce binary size, it is possible to compile custom export
templates with certain features disabled. This is described in detail
in Optimizing a build for size. However, determining which features
need to be disabled can be a tedious task. The engine compilation
configuration editor aims to address this by providing an interface to
view and manage these features easily, while also being able to detect
the features currently being used in the project.

The Project > Tools > Engine Compilation Configuration Editor allows
you to create and manage build profiles for your Godot project.

From now on, you have two possibilities:

* View the list and manually uncheck features that you don't need.

* Use the Detect from Project button to automatically detect features
  currently used in the project and disable unused features. Note that
  this will override the existing list of features, so if you have
  manually unchecked some items, their state will be reset based on
  whether the project actually uses the feature.

Once you click Detect from Project, the project detection step will
run. This can take from a few seconds up to several minutes depending
on the project size. Once detection is complete, you'll see an updated
list of features with some features disabled:

Warning:

  Unchecking features in this dialog will not reduce binary size
  directly on export. Since it is only possible to actually remove
  features from the binary at compile-time, you still need to compile
  custom export templates with the build profile specified to actually
  benefit from the engine compilation configuration editor.

You can now save the build profile by clicking **Save As** at the top.
The build profile can be saved in any location, but it's a good idea
to save it somewhere in your project folder and add it to version
control to be able to go back to it later when needed. This also
allows using version control to track changes to the build profile.

The build profile is a JSON file (and ".gdbuild" extension) that looks
like this after detection in the above example:

   {
       "disabled_build_options": {
           "disable_navigation_3d": true,
           "disable_xr": true,
           "module_godot_physics_3d_enabled": false,
           "module_msdfgen_enabled": false,
           "module_openxr_enabled": false
       },
       "disabled_classes": [
           "AESContext",
           ...
           "ZIPReader"
       ],
       "type": "build_profile"
   }

This file can be passed as a SCons option when compiling export
templates:

   scons target=template_release build_profile=/path/to/profile.gdbuild

The buildsystem will use this to disable unused classes and reduce
binary size as a result.


Limitations
===========

The Detect from Project functionality relies on reading the project's
scenes and scripts. It will not be able to detect used features in the
following scenarios:

* Features that are used in GDScripts that are procedurally created
  then run at runtime.

* Features that are used in expressions.

* Features that are used in GDExtensions, unless the language binding
  allows for defining used classes and the extension makes use of the
  functionality. See GH-104129 for details.

* Features that are used in external PCKs loaded at runtime.

* Certain edge cases may exist. If unsure, please open an issue on
  GitHub with a minimal reproduction project attached.

  You can achieve further size reductions by passing other options
  that reduce binary size. See Optimizing a build for size for more
  information.
