Godot Android library
*********************

The Godot Engine for Android platforms is designed to be used as an
Android library. This architecture enables several key features on
Android platforms:

* Ability to integrate the Gradle build system within the Godot
  Editor, which provides the ability to leverage more components from
  the Android ecosystem such as libraries and tools

* Ability to make the engine portable and embeddable:

  * Key in enabling the port of the Godot Editor to Android and mobile
    XR devices

  * Key in allowing the integration and reuse of Godot's capabilities
    within existing codebase

Below we describe some of the use-cases and scenarios this
architecture enables.


Using the Godot Android library
===============================

The Godot Android library is packaged as an AAR archive file and
hosted on MavenCentral along with its documentation.

It provides access to Godot APIs and capabilities on Android platforms
for the following non-exhaustive use-cases.


Godot Android plugins
=====================

Android plugins are powerful tools to extend the capabilities of the
Godot Engine by tapping into the functionality provided by Android
platforms and ecosystem.

An Android plugin is an Android library with a dependency on the Godot
Android library which the plugin uses to integrate into the engine's
lifecycle and to access Godot APIs, granting it powerful capabilities
such as GDExtension support which allows to update / mod the engine
behavior as needed.

For more information, see Godot Android plugins.


Embedding Godot in existing Android projects
============================================

The Godot Engine can be embedded within existing Android applications
or libraries, allowing developers to leverage mature and battle-tested
code and libraries better suited to a specific task.

The hosting component is responsible for driving the engine lifecycle
via Godot's Android APIs. These APIs can also be used to provide
bidirectional communication between the host and the embedded Godot
instance allowing for greater control over the desired experience.

We showcase how this is done using a sample Android app that embeds
the Godot Engine as an Android view, and uses it to render 3D glTF
models.

The GLTF Viewer sample app uses an Android RecyclerView component to
create a list of glTF items, populated from Kenney's Food Kit pack.
When an item on the list is selected, the app's logic interacts with
the embedded Godot Engine to render the selected glTF item as a 3D
model.

The sample app source code can be found on GitHub. Follow the
instructions on its README to build and install it.

Below we break-down the steps used to create the GLTF Viewer app.

Warning:

  Currently only a single instance of the Godot Engine is supported
  per process. You can configure the process the Android Activity runs
  under using the android:process attribute.

Warning:

  Automatic resizing / orientation configuration events are not
  supported and may cause a crash. You can disable those events:

  * By locking to a specific orientation using the
    android:screenOrientation attribute.

  * By declaring that the Activity will handle these configuration
    events using the android:configChanges attribute.


1. Create the Android app
-------------------------

Note:

  The Android sample app was created using Android Studio and using
  Gradle as the build system.The Android ecosystem provides multiple
  tools, IDEs, build systems for creating Android apps so feel free to
  use what you're familiar with, and update the steps below
  accordingly (contributions to this documentation are welcomed as
  well!).

* Set up an Android application project. It may be a brand new empty
  project, or an existing project

* Add the maven dependency for the Godot Android library

  * If using "gradle", add the following to the "dependency" section
    of the app's gradle build file. Make sure to update "<version>" to
    the latest version of the Godot Android library:

     implementation("org.godotengine:godot:<version>")

* If using "gradle", include the following "aaptOptions" configuration
  under the "android > defaultConfig" section of the app's gradle
  build file. Doing so allows "gradle" to include Godot's hidden
  directories when building the app binary.

  * If your build system does not support including hidden
    directories, you can configure the Godot project to not use hidden
    directories by deselecting Application > Config > Use Hidden
    Project Data Directory in the Project Settings.

   android {

     defaultConfig {
         // The default ignore pattern for the 'assets' directory includes hidden files and
         // directories which are used by Godot projects, so we override it with the following.
         aaptOptions {
             ignoreAssetsPattern "!.svn:!.git:!.gitignore:!.ds_store:!*.scc:<dir>_*:!CVS:!thumbs.db:!picasa.ini:!*~"
         }
       ...

* Create / update the application's Activity that will be hosting the
  Godot Engine instance. For the sample app, this is MainActivity

  * The host Activity should implement the GodotHost interface

  * The sample app uses Fragments to organize its UI, so it uses
    GodotFragment, a fragment component provided by the Godot Android
    library to automatically host and manage the Godot Engine
    instance.

     private var godotFragment: GodotFragment? = null

     override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
         super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)

         setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)

         val currentGodotFragment = supportFragmentManager.findFragmentById(R.id.godot_fragment_container)
         if (currentGodotFragment is GodotFragment) {
             godotFragment = currentGodotFragment
         } else {
             godotFragment = GodotFragment()
             supportFragmentManager.beginTransaction()
                 .replace(R.id.godot_fragment_container, godotFragment!!)
                 .commitNowAllowingStateLoss()
         }

         ...

Note:

  The Godot Android library also provide GodotActivity, an Activity
  component that can be extended to automatically host and manage the
  Godot Engine instance.Alternatively, applications can directly
  create a Godot instance, host and manage it themselves.

* Using GodotHost#getHostPlugins(...), the sample app creates a
  runtime GodotPlugin instance that's used to send signals to the
  "gdscript" logic

  * The runtime "GodotPlugin" can also be used by "gdscript" logic to
    access JVM methods. For more information, see Godot Android
    plugins.

* Add any additional logic that will be used by your application

  * For the sample app, this includes adding the
    ItemsSelectionFragment fragment (and related classes), a fragment
    used to build and show the list of glTF items

* Open the "AndroidManifest.xml" file, and configure the orientation
  if needed using the android:screenOrientation attribute

  * If needed, disable automatic resizing / orientation configuration
    changes using the android:configChanges attribute

   <activity android:name=".MainActivity"
       android:screenOrientation="fullUser"
       android:configChanges="orientation|screenSize|smallestScreenSize|screenLayout"
       android:exported="true">

       ...
   </activity>


2. Create the Godot project
---------------------------

Note:

  On Android, Godot's project files are exported to the "assets"
  directory of the generated "apk" binary.We leverage that
  architecture to bind our Android app and Godot project together by
  creating the Godot project in the Android app's "assets"
  directory.Note that it's also possible to create the Godot project
  in a separate directory and export it as a PCK or ZIP file to the
  Android app's "assets" directory. Using this approach requires
  passing the "--main-pack
  <pck_or_zip_filepath_relative_to_assets_dir>" argument to the hosted
  Godot Engine instance using GodotHost#getCommandLine().Example:

     @Override
     public List<String> getCommandLine(){
         List<String> results = new ArrayList<>();
         results.addAll(super.getCommandLine());
         results.add("--main-pack");
         results.add("res://foo.pck");
         return results;
     }

  The instructions below and the sample app follow the first approach
  of creating the Godot project in the Android app's "assets"
  directory.

* As mentioned in the **note** above, open the Godot Editor and create
  a Godot project directly (no subfolder) in the "assets" directory of
  the Android application project

  * See the sample app's Godot project for reference

* Configure the Godot project as desired

  * Make sure the orientation set for the Godot project matches the
    one set in the Android app's manifest

  * For Android, make sure textures/vram_compression/import_etc2_astc
    is set to *true*

* Update the Godot project script logic as needed

  * For the sample app, the script logic queries for the runtime
    "GodotPlugin" instance and uses it to register for signals fired
    by the app logic

  * The app logic fires a signal every time an item is selected in the
    list. The signal contains the filepath of the glTF model, which is
    used by the "gdscript" logic to render the model.

     extends Node3D

     # Reference to the gltf model that's currently being shown.
     var current_gltf_node: Node3D = null

     func _ready():
       # Default asset to load when the app starts
       _load_gltf("res://gltfs/food_kit/turkey.glb")

       var appPlugin = Engine.get_singleton("AppPlugin")
       if appPlugin:
         print("App plugin is available")

         # Signal fired from the app logic to update the gltf model being shown
         appPlugin.connect("show_gltf", _load_gltf)
       else:
         print("App plugin is not available")


     # Load the gltf model specified by the given path
     func _load_gltf(gltf_path: String):
       if current_gltf_node != null:
         remove_child(current_gltf_node)

       current_gltf_node = load(gltf_path).instantiate()

       add_child(current_gltf_node)


3. Build and run the app
------------------------

Once you complete configuration of your Godot project, build and run
the Android app. If set up correctly, the host Activity will
initialize the embedded Godot Engine on startup. The Godot Engine will
check the "assets" directory for project files to load (unless
configured to look for a "main pack"), and will proceed to run the
project.

While the app is running on device, you can check Android logcat to
investigate any errors or crashes.

For reference, check the build and install instructions for the GLTF
Viewer sample app.
