List of features
****************

This page aims to list **all** features currently supported by Godot.

Note:

  This page lists features supported by the current stable version of
  Godot. Some of these features are not available in the 3.x release
  series.


Platforms
=========

See also:

  See System requirements for hardware and software version
  requirements.

**Can run both the editor and exported projects:**

* Windows (x86 and ARM, 64-bit and 32-bit).

* macOS (x86 and ARM, 64-bit only).

* Linux (x86 and ARM, 64-bit and 32-bit).

     * Binaries are statically linked and can run on any distribution
       if compiled on an old enough base distribution.

     * Official binaries are compiled using the Godot Engine
       buildroot, allowing for binaries that work across common Linux
       distributions.

* Android (editor support is experimental).

* Web browsers. Experimental in 4.0, using Godot 3.x is recommended
  instead when targeting HTML5.

Note:

  Linux supports rv64 (RISC-V), ppc64 & ppc32 (PowerPC), and
  loongarch64. However you must compile the editor for that platform
  (as well as export templates) yourself, no official downloads are
  currently provided. RISC-V compiling instructions can be found on
  the Compiling for Linux, *BSD page.

**Runs exported projects:**

* iOS.

* Consoles.

Godot aims to be as platform-independent as possible and can be ported
to new platforms with relative ease.

Note:

  Projects written in C# using Godot 4 currently cannot be exported to
  the web platform. To use C# on that platform, consider Godot 3
  instead. Android and iOS platform support is available as of Godot
  4.2, but is experimental and some limitations apply.


Editor
======

**Features:**

* Scene tree editor.

* Built-in script editor.

* Support for external script editors such as Visual Studio Code or
  Vim.

* GDScript debugger.

     * Support for debugging in threads is available since 4.2.

* Visual profiler with CPU and GPU time indications for each step of
  the rendering pipeline.

* Performance monitoring tools, including custom performance monitors.

* Live script reloading.

* Live scene editing.

     * Changes will reflect in the editor and will be kept after
       closing the running project.

* Remote inspector.

     * Changes won't reflect in the editor and won't be kept after
       closing the running project.

* Live camera replication.

     * Move the in-editor camera and see the result in the running
       project.

* Built-in offline class reference documentation.

* Use the editor in dozens of languages contributed by the community.

**Plugins:**

* Editor plugins can be downloaded from the asset library to extend
  editor functionality.

* Create your own plugins using GDScript to add new features or speed
  up your workflow.

* Download projects from the asset library in the Project Manager and
  import them directly.


Rendering
=========

Godot 4 includes three renderers:

* **Forward+**. The most advanced renderer, suited for desktop
  platforms only. Used by default on desktop platforms. This renderer
  uses **Vulkan**, **Direct3D 12**, or **Metal** as the rendering
  driver, and it uses the **RenderingDevice** backend.

* **Mobile**. Fewer features, but renders simple scenes faster. Suited
  for mobile and desktop platforms. Used by default on mobile
  platforms. This renderer uses **Vulkan**, **Direct3D 12**, or
  **Metal** as the rendering driver, and it uses the
  **RenderingDevice** backend.

* **Compatibility**, sometimes called **GL Compatibility**. The least
  advanced renderer, suited for low-end desktop and mobile platforms.
  Used by default on the web platform. This renderer uses **OpenGL**
  as the rendering driver.

See Overview of renderers for a detailed comparison of the rendering
methods.


2D graphics
===========

* Sprite, polygon and line rendering.

     * High-level tools to draw lines and polygons such as Polygon2D
       and Line2D, with support for texturing.

* AnimatedSprite2D as a helper for creating animated sprites.

* Parallax layers.

     * Pseudo-3D support including preview in the editor.

* 2D lighting with normal maps and specular maps.

     * Point (omni/spot) and directional 2D lights.

     * Hard or soft shadows (adjustable on a per-light basis).

     * Custom shaders can access a real-time SDF (Signed Distance
       Field) representation of the 2D scene based on LightOccluder2D
       nodes, which can be used for improved 2D lighting effects
       including 2D global illumination.

* Font rendering using bitmaps, rasterization using FreeType or multi-
  channel signed distance fields (MSDF).

     * Bitmap fonts can be exported using tools like BMFont, or
       imported from images (for fixed-width fonts only).

     * Dynamic fonts support monochrome fonts as well as colored fonts
       (e.g. for emoji). Supported formats are TTF, OTF, WOFF1 and
       WOFF2.

     * Dynamic fonts support optional font outlines with adjustable
       width and color.

     * Dynamic fonts support variable fonts and OpenType features
       including ligatures.

     * Dynamic fonts support simulated bold and italic when the font
       file lacks those styles.

     * Dynamic fonts support oversampling to keep fonts sharp at
       higher resolutions.

     * Dynamic fonts support subpixel positioning to make fonts
       crisper at low sizes.

     * Dynamic fonts support LCD subpixel optimizations to make fonts
       even crisper at low sizes.

     * Signed distance field fonts can be scaled at any resolution
       without requiring re-rasterization. Multi-channel usage makes
       SDF fonts scale down to lower sizes better compared to
       monochrome SDF fonts.

* GPU-based particles with support for custom particle shaders.

  in the editor).


3D graphics
===========

* HDR rendering with sRGB.

* Perspective, orthographic and frustum-offset cameras.

* When using the Forward+ renderer, a depth prepass is used to improve
  performance in complex scenes by reducing the cost of overdraw.

* Variable rate shading on supported GPUs in Forward+ and Mobile.

**Physically-based rendering (built-in material features):**

* Follows the Disney PBR model.

* Supports Burley, Lambert, Lambert Wrap (half-Lambert) and Toon
  diffuse shading modes.

* Supports Schlick-GGX, Toon and Disabled specular shading modes.

* Uses a roughness-metallic workflow with support for ORM textures.

* Uses horizon specular occlusion (Filament model) to improve material
  appearance.

* Normal mapping.

* Parallax/relief mapping with automatic level of detail based on
  distance.

* Detail mapping for the albedo and normal maps.

* Sub-surface scattering and transmittance.

* Screen-space refraction with support for material roughness
  (resulting in blurry refraction).

* Proximity fade (soft particles) and distance fade.

* Distance fade can use alpha blending or dithering to avoid going
  through the transparent pipeline.

* Dithering can be determined on a per-pixel or per-object basis.

**Real-time lighting:**

* Directional lights (sun/moon). Up to 4 per scene.

* Omnidirectional lights.

* Spot lights with adjustable cone angle and attenuation.

* Specular, indirect light, and volumetric fog energy can be adjusted
  on a per-light basis.

* Adjustable light "size" for fake area lights (will also make shadows
  blurrier).

* Optional distance fade system to fade distant lights and their
  shadows, improving performance.

* When using the Forward+ renderer (default on desktop), lights are
  rendered with clustered forward optimizations to decrease their
  individual cost. Clustered rendering also lifts any limits on the
  number of lights that can be used on a mesh.

* When using the Mobile renderer, up to 8 omni lights and 8 spot
  lights can be displayed per mesh resource. Baked lighting can be
  used to overcome this limit if needed.

**Shadow mapping:**

* *DirectionalLight:* Orthogonal (fastest), PSSM 2-split and 4-split.
  Supports blending between splits.

* *OmniLight:* Dual paraboloid (fast) or cubemap (slower but more
  accurate). Supports colored projector textures in the form of
  panoramas.

* *SpotLight:* Single texture. Supports colored projector textures.

* Shadow normal offset bias and shadow pancaking to decrease the
  amount of visible shadow acne and peter-panning.

* PCSS (Percentage Closer Soft Shadows)-like shadow blur based on the
  light size and distance from the surface the shadow is cast on.

* Adjustable shadow blur on a per-light basis.

**Global illumination with indirect lighting:**

* Baked lightmaps (fast, but can't be updated at runtime).

     * Supports baking indirect light only or baking both direct and
       indirect lighting. The bake mode can be adjusted on a per-light
       basis to allow for hybrid light baking setups.

     * Supports lighting dynamic objects using automatic and manually
       placed probes.

     * Optionally supports directional lighting and rough reflections
       based on spherical harmonics.

     * Lightmaps are baked on the GPU using compute shaders (much
       faster compared to CPU lightmapping). Baking can only be
       performed from the editor, not in exported projects.

     * Supports GPU-based denoising with JNLM, or CPU/GPU-based
       denoising with OIDN.

* Voxel-based GI probes. Supports dynamic lights *and* dynamic
  occluders, while also supporting reflections. Requires a fast baking
  step which can be performed in the editor or at runtime (including
  from an exported project).

* Signed-distance field GI designed for large open worlds. Supports
  dynamic lights, but not dynamic occluders. Supports reflections. No
  baking required.

* Screen-space indirect lighting (SSIL) at half or full resolution.
  Fully real-time and supports any kind of emissive light source
  (including decals).

* VoxelGI and SDFGI use a deferred pass to allow for rendering GI at
  half resolution to improve performance (while still having
  functional MSAA support).

**Reflections:**

* Voxel-based reflections (when using GI probes) and SDF-based
  reflections (when using signed distance field GI). Voxel-based
  reflections are visible on transparent surfaces, while rough SDF-
  based reflections are visible on transparent surfaces.

* Fast baked reflections or slow real-time reflections using
  ReflectionProbe. Parallax box correction can optionally be enabled.

* Screen-space reflections with support for material roughness.

* Reflection techniques can be mixed together for greater accuracy or
  scalability.

* When using the Forward+ renderer (default on desktop), reflection
  probes are rendered with clustered forward optimizations to decrease
  their individual cost. Clustered rendering also lifts any limits on
  the number of reflection probes that can be used on a mesh.

* When using the Mobile renderer, up to 8 reflection probes can be
  displayed per mesh resource. When using the Compatibility renderer,
  up to 2 reflection probes can be displayed per mesh resource.

**Decals:**

* Supports albedo, emissive, ORM (Occlusion Roughness Metallic), and
  normal mapping.

* Texture channels are smoothly overlaid on top of the underlying
  material, with support for normal/ORM-only decals.

* Support for normal fade to fade the decal depending on its incidence
  angle.

* Does not rely on runtime mesh generation. This means decals can be
  used on complex skinned meshes with no performance penalty, even if
  the decal moves every frame.

* Support for nearest, bilinear, trilinear or anisotropic texture
  filtering (configured globally).

* Optional distance fade system to fade distant decals, improving
  performance.

* When using the Forward+ renderer (default on desktop), decals are
  rendered with clustered forward optimizations to decrease their
  individual cost. Clustered rendering also lifts any limits on the
  number of decals that can be used on a mesh.

* When using the Mobile renderer, up to 8 decals can be displayed per
  mesh resource.

**Sky:**

* Panorama sky (using an HDRI).

* Procedural sky and Physically-based sky that respond to the
  DirectionalLights in the scene.

* Support for custom sky shaders, which can be animated.

* The radiance map used for ambient and specular light can be updated
  in real-time depending on the quality settings chosen.

**Fog:**

* Exponential depth fog.

* Exponential height fog.

* Support for automatic fog color depending on the sky color (aerial
  perspective).

* Support for sun scattering in the fog.

* Support for controlling how much fog rendering should affect the
  sky, with separate controls for traditional and volumetric fog.

* Support for making specific materials ignore fog.

**Volumetric fog:**

* Global volumetric fog that reacts to lights and shadows.

* Volumetric fog can take indirect light into account when using
  VoxelGI or SDFGI.

* Fog volume nodes that can be placed to add fog to specific areas (or
  remove fog from specific areas). Supported shapes include box,
  ellipse, cone, cylinder, and 3D texture-based density maps.

* Each fog volume can have its own custom shader.

* Can be used together with traditional fog.

**Particles:**

* GPU-based particles with support for subemitters (2D + 3D), trails
  (2D + 3D), attractors (3D only) and collision (2D + 3D).

  * 3D particle attractor shapes supported: box, sphere and 3D vector
    fields.

  * 3D particle collision shapes supported: box, sphere, baked signed
    distance field and real-time heightmap (suited for open world
    weather effects).

  * 2D particle collision is handled using a signed distance field
    generated in real-time based on LightOccluder2D nodes in the
    scene.

  * Trails can use the built-in ribbon trail and tube trail meshes, or
    custom meshes with skeletons.

  * Support for custom particle shaders with manual emission.

* CPU-based particles.

**Post-processing:**

* Tonemapping (Linear, Reinhard, Filmic, ACES, AgX).

* Automatic exposure adjustments based on viewport brightness (and
  manual exposure override).

* Near and far depth of field with adjustable bokeh simulation (box,
  hexagon, circle).

* Screen-space ambient occlusion (SSAO) at half or full resolution.

* Glow/bloom with optional bicubic upscaling and several blend modes
  available: Screen, Soft Light, Add, Replace, Mix.

* Glow can have a colored dirt map texture, acting as a lens dirt
  effect.

* Glow can be used as a screen-space blur effect.

* Color correction using a one-dimensional ramp or a 3D LUT texture.

* Roughness limiter to reduce the impact of specular aliasing.

* Brightness, contrast and saturation adjustments.

**Texture filtering:**

* Nearest, bilinear, trilinear or anisotropic filtering.

* Filtering options are defined on a per-use basis, not a per-texture
  basis.

**Texture compression:**

* Basis Universal (slow, but results in smaller files).

* BPTC for high-quality compression (not supported on macOS).

* ETC2 (not supported on macOS).

* S3TC (not supported on mobile/Web platforms).

**Antialiasing:**

* Temporal antialiasing (TAA).

* AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 2.2 antialiasing (FSR2), which can
  be used at native resolution as a form of high-quality temporal
  antialiasing.

* Multi-sample antialiasing (MSAA), for both 2D antialiasing and 3D
  antialiasing.

* Fast approximate antialiasing (FXAA).

* Super-sample antialiasing (SSAA) using bilinear 3D scaling and a 3D
  resolution scale above 1.0.

* Alpha antialiasing, MSAA alpha to coverage and alpha hashing on a
  per-material basis.

**Resolution scaling:**

* Support for rendering 3D at a lower resolution while keeping 2D
  rendering at the original scale. This can be used to improve
  performance on low-end systems or improve visuals on high-end
  systems.

* Resolution scaling uses bilinear filtering, AMD FidelityFX Super
  Resolution 1.0 (FSR1) or AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 2.2 (FSR2).

* Texture mipmap LOD bias is adjusted automatically to improve quality
  at lower resolution scales. It can also be modified with a manual
  offset.

Most effects listed above can be adjusted for better performance or to
further improve quality. This can be helpful when using Godot for
offline rendering.

* Load and save images, audio/video, fonts and ZIP archives in an
  exported project without having to go through Godot's import system.

* Pack game data into a PCK file (custom format optimized for fast
  seeking), into a ZIP archive, or directly into the executable for
  single-file distribution.

* Export additional PCK files that can be read by the engine to
  support mods and DLCs.


Miscellaneous
=============

* Video playback with built-in support for Ogg Theora.

* Movie Maker mode to record videos from a running project with
  synchronized audio and perfect frame pacing.

* Low-level access to servers which allows bypassing the scene tree's
  overhead when needed.

     * Export and deploy projects using continuous integration
       platforms.

     * Shell completion scripts are available for Bash, zsh and fish.

     * Print colored text to standard output on all platforms using
       print_rich.

* The editor can detect features used in a project and create a
  compilation profile, which can be used to create smaller export
  template binaries with unneeded features disabled.

* Support for C++ modules statically linked into the engine binary.

  * Most built-in modules can be disabled at compile-time to reduce
    binary size in custom builds. See Optimizing a build for size for
    details.

* Engine and editor written in C++17.

     * Can be compiled using GCC, Clang and MSVC. MinGW is also
       supported.

     * Friendly towards packagers. In most cases, system libraries can
       be used instead of the ones provided by Godot. The build system
       doesn't download anything. Builds can be fully reproducible.

* Licensed under the permissive MIT license.

     * Open development process with contributions welcome.
