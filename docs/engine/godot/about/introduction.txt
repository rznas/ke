Welcome to the official documentation of **Godot Engine**, the free
and open source community-driven 2D and 3D game engine! Behind this
mouthful, you will find a powerful yet user-friendly tool that you can
use to develop any kind of game, for any platform and with no usage
restriction whatsoever.

This page gives a broad overview of the engine and of this
documentation, so that you know where to start if you are a beginner
or where to look if you need information on a specific feature.


Before you start
================

The Tutorials and resources page lists video tutorials contributed by
the community. If you prefer video to text, consider checking them
out. Otherwise, Getting Started is a great starting point.

In case you have trouble with one of the tutorials or your project,
you can find help on the various Community channels, especially the
Godot Discord community and Forum.


About Godot Engine
==================

A game engine is a complex tool and difficult to present in a few
words. Here's a quick synopsis, which you are free to reuse if you
need a quick write-up about Godot Engine:

   Godot Engine is a feature-packed, cross-platform game engine to
   create 2D and 3D games from a unified interface. It provides a
   comprehensive set of common tools, so that users can focus on
   making games without having to reinvent the wheel. Games can be
   exported with one click to a number of platforms, including the
   major desktop platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows), mobile platforms
   (Android, iOS), as well as Web-based platforms and consoles.

   Godot is completely free and open source under the permissive MIT
   license. No strings attached, no royalties, nothing. Users' games
   are theirs, down to the last line of engine code. Godot's
   development is fully independent and community-driven, empowering
   users to help shape their engine to match their expectations. It is
   supported by the Godot Foundation not-for-profit.


Organization of the documentation
=================================

This documentation is organized into several sections:

* **About** contains this introduction as well as information about
  the engine, its history, its licensing, authors, etc. It also
  contains the Frequently asked questions.

* **Getting Started** contains all necessary information on using the
  engine to make games. It starts with the Introduction section which
  should be the entry point for all new users. **This is the best
  place to start if you're new!**

* The **Manual** can be read or referenced as needed, in any order. It
  contains feature-specific tutorials and documentation.

* **Engine details** contains sections intended for advanced users and
  contributors, with information on compiling the engine, working on
  the editor, or developing C++ modules.

* **Community** is dedicated to the life of Godot's community and
  contains a list of recommended third-party tutorials and materials
  outside of this documentation. It also provides details on the Asset
  Library. It also used to list Godot communities, which are now
  listed on the Godot website.

* Finally, the **Class reference** documents the full Godot API, also
  available directly within the engine's script editor. You can find
  information on all classes, functions, signals and so on here.

In addition to this documentation, you may also want to take a look at
the various Godot demo projects.
