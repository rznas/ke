## **Key Insights from the Diagrams:**

### **Critical Dependencies:**
- **Iraj's Murder** → Creates the Iran-Turan eternal conflict (affects everything after)
- **Rostam + Tahmineh** → Must happen 17 years before Sohrab tragedy
- **Siavash's Death** → Directly motivates Kay Khosrow's entire storyline
- **Esfandiyar** → Requires Zoroastrian conversion arc first

### **For Your 2-Person Team:**
The diagrams clearly show the **3-Episode Trilogy** (Path 2) is ideal:

**Episode 1: Seven Trials** (Independent)
- ✅ No dependencies
- ✅ Teaches combat
- ✅ Establishes Rostam

**Episode 2: Sohrab Tragedy** (Requires Episode 1)
- ✅ Only needs Tahmineh meeting (post-credits scene in Ep 1)
- ✅ Emotional peak
- ✅ Reuses combat system

**Episode 3: Kay Khosrow** (Requires Episodes 1-2)
- ✅ Parallel structure to Sohrab (both father-son tragedies)
- ✅ Expands to politics/war
- ✅ Complete story arc

### **Asset Efficiency:**
From the diagrams, you can see:
- **Rostam model** used in all 3 episodes (just age him)
- **Combat system** built once, refined each episode
- **Persian architecture** reusable across episodes
- **New assets per episode**: ~2-3 main characters, 3-5 environments

### **Development Timeline (from Gantt):**
- **Months 1-6**: Episode 1 (Seven Trials)
- **Months 7-12**: Episode 2 (Sohrab) 
- **Months 13-18**: Episode 3 (Kay Khosrow)
- **Months 19-20**: Polish & Complete Edition

Each episode releases 6-8 months apart, creating steady revenue and player engagement.
