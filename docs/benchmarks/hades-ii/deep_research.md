# Hades II benchmark analysis for Shahnameh development

**Bottom line:** Hades II represents a near-impossible standard for a 2-person team to match directly—**25 developers, 4.5 years, $55M+ revenue, 94 Metacritic**—but its core design philosophy of "quality through iteration, not scale" offers directly applicable lessons. Supergiant's success stems from ruthless scoping (roguelike structure multiplies asset value), single-person audio/art leadership, proprietary tools optimized for their workflow, and treating Early Access as a development partner. For Shahnameh, the extractable wisdom lies in their mythology adaptation approach, combat "feel" principles, and narrative-through-repetition systems—all achievable without their budget.

## Commercial performance sets unrealistic expectations

Hades II launched from Early Access on **September 25, 2025** after 18 months of public development, achieving extraordinary commercial success. The game sold **over 2 million copies** during Early Access alone, generating approximately **$55 million in gross revenue** on Steam (third-party estimates; Supergiant doesn't disclose figures). At $29.99 regular price ($22.49 during current Winter Sale), peak concurrent players hit **112,947**—doubling the original Hades' all-time record.

Critical reception proved exceptional: **94 Metacritic (PC), 98 Metacritic (Switch), 96% positive Steam reviews** from 99,000+ ratings. IGN, GameSpot, and Game Informer all awarded perfect 10/10 scores. The Game Awards 2024 named it Best Action Game.

For context, Supergiant operates with **~25 employees** (grown from 7 founders in 2009) and spent **4.5 years** on Hades II—their longest development cycle. They've never taken external funding, self-publish, and maintain near-zero employee turnover. This is an established studio at peak maturity, not a comparable starting point for a 2-person team.

## What players actually praise reveals design priorities

Steam and Reddit analysis surfaces consistent themes about what makes Hades II resonate:

**Combat build variety** dominates praise—players cite "nearly limitless ways to build abilities" with the new Omega attack system (hold buttons for charged variants) and magick resource management adding strategic depth. The key insight: **variety creates replayability without new content**.

**Art and audio quality** receives universal acclaim. Jen Zee's hand-painted environments and Darren Korb's "Mediterranean prog rock Halloween" soundtrack—featuring Greek bouzouki, Turkish lavta, and metal guitar layered dynamically—establish instant atmosphere. Players report **30+ hours without repeated dialogue** from the 30,000+ voice lines.

**Dual-path structure** (descending to Underworld OR ascending to Olympus) effectively doubles content perception. Players praise the "bigger, deeper mythic world" without Supergiant building truly twice the game.

**The "one more run" loop** works because failure advances narrative. Characters comment on your deaths, recent encounters, and equipped weapons. This makes losing feel productive rather than punishing.

---

## Primary criticisms expose narrative design risks

The **most significant backlash** concerns the story ending—players feel Chronos's redemption arc resolves "too fast after hours of buildup" in "a 3-minute conversation." More critically, many feel **protagonist Melinoë gets sidelined** in her own game when returning character Zagreus takes center stage in the finale.

Combat criticisms focus on **slower pacing** than Hades 1. Melinoë's single dash (versus Zagreus's triple dash) and more deliberate weapon animations make combat "more methodical"—divisive among fans who preferred the original's "constant zappy movement."

**Lesson for Shahnameh:** Narrative resolution requires proportionate investment. If players spend 50+ hours with a protagonist, the conclusion must honor that journey. The Melinoë backlash specifically warns against introducing returning/legacy characters who overshadow your new protagonist.

## Mythology adaptation philosophy offers direct templates

Supergiant's approach to Greek mythology provides a framework directly applicable to Shahnameh's Persian epic adaptation:

**Classical sources as seeds, not scripts.** Art Director Jen Zee explained: "From the start of development, we agreed it was important to draw upon classical source material as the seed for our creative endeavours." They researched 'The Complete World of Greek Mythology' by Richard Buxton and Encyclopedia Britannica, seeking "the original, oldest myths we can find."

**Universalize the culture.** Creative Director Greg Kasavin's philosophy: "They're called the Greek gods because they were worshiped in ancient Greece, not because they themselves are ethnically Greek. Zeus rules all the heavens, not just the airspace over Greece. So it stands to reason that the gods represent all the people of the world." This approach earned academic attention from King's College London and praise for inclusive representation.

**Character tonality stacking.** Before visual design, they establish top 3 tonal qualities per character (e.g., Odysseus: "rugged, cool, neighbourly"). Both Creative Director and Art Director must agree on final designs.

**Modernize problematic elements.** Persephone's story was reimagined: she "fled Olympus due to its stifling environment and came to the Underworld of her own volition"—updating consent themes without abandoning the mythological framework.

**For Shahnameh specifically:** The epic's heroes (Rostam, Sohrab, Simorgh) carry cultural significance requiring similar sensitivity. Research primary Persian sources, establish clear tonal identities before design, and modernize elements thoughtfully while maintaining mythological grounding.

## Combat design achieves "feel" through deliberate constraints

Hades II's combat is described as "responsive and tactical" with "weapon variety" ranging from "lightning-fast" to "powerfully weighty." The design philosophy prioritizes **precision over speed**—one reviewer summarized: "If Hades is action, Hades II is precision."

**Animation commitment matters.** Weapons have "specific arcs and animations that can leave her vulnerable." This isn't Dark Souls-level commitment, but attacks aren't freely cancellable. Button mashing fails; "you have to think on the fly about how to effectively manage various enemy types."

**Boss design patterns:**
- Multi-phase escalation (Hades boss adds laser attacks, darkness phases, minion summoning)
- Learnable movesets with generous windups ("whenever I died I knew it was because I made a mistake")
- Musical integration (Scylla "quite literally sings incredibly catchy songs while you fight")
- Optional "Extreme Measures" modifiers add attacks and health for challenge seekers

**Combat satisfaction sources:**
- Hits stagger enemies, "interrupting their attacks and movement" so aggression pays off
- Combos preserve through dashes—"your combo will not restart if you press attack immediately after"
- Boon synergies create exponential power, rewarding build experimentation
- God Mode accessibility reduces damage taken with each death for struggling players

**For Shahnameh:** Focus on readable enemy windups, clear hit feedback, and build variety over mechanical complexity. The Persian epic's combat could emphasize heroic single-combat moments (like Rostam vs. the White Demon) with learnable boss patterns rather than mob-wave encounters.

## Roguelike structure enables small-team content efficiency

The roguelike format provides Supergiant's core content multiplication strategy:

**Death advances narrative.** Lead writer Greg Kasavin: "We wanted there to always be some sense of forward progress, if not through acquisition of resources or new talents, then in the story/character relationships." Characters remember your deaths, comment on your weapons, and reveal personal stories over dozens of runs.

**Meta-progression layers:**
- Mirror of Night: permanent stat upgrades
- Weapon unlocks with multiple Aspects each
- Arcana Cards (Hades II's tarot loadout system)
- Pact of Punishment/Oath of the Unseen: voluntary difficulty modifiers

**For episodic structure translation:** Shahnameh's episodic model (2-3 hours per episode) can borrow the meta-progression psychology without roguelike repetition. Each episode could unlock permanent hero abilities, relationship developments, and equipment that carries forward—maintaining the "investment compounds" feeling without requiring death loops.

The dual-path structure (two equally valid routes) demonstrates how choice multiplies perceived content without doubling production. Shahnameh episodes could offer branching narrative paths through the epic's stories.

## Audio production shows one-person excellence is achievable

Darren Korb handles **all audio at Supergiant single-handedly**: composition, sound effects, and voice recording direction. This validates that integrated audio leadership works at professional quality.

**His approach:**
- "Mediterranean prog rock Halloween" genre blend using traditional instruments (Greek bouzouki, Turkish lavta, Turkish baglama) with metal guitar and synthesizers
- Dynamic layering: combat adds heavier instrumentation to base melodic tracks
- Character-specific palettes (Zagreus gets "rocking elements"; Hades gets acoustic themes; Persephone gets orchestral)
- **4+ hours of music** in Hades II (52 tracks)
- Orchestral arrangements recorded at Abbey Road Studios for 1.0 release

**Voice acting efficiency:**
- Most voice actors are Supergiant staff members
- Minimal takes: "very often it's 'Hey, who are we doing today? Achilles? Great'—actors read lines once or twice before recording"
- Recording originally in Korb's bedroom when he and Logan Cunningham were roommates
- **22,000+ voice lines** from <20 employees during a pandemic

**For Shahnameh with AudioCraft:** Persian instruments (tar, setar, kamancheh, tombak) could anchor a similarly distinctive cultural soundscape. AudioCraft can generate atmospheric stems; human composition handles hero themes. Consider text-to-speech placeholder dialogue during development, with targeted human voice recording for critical emotional beats in final releases.

## Development efficiency strategies for resource-constrained teams

Supergiant's workflow philosophy applies regardless of team size:

**"The game is the design document."** They don't use "long, elaborate design documents." Structure processes around learning: "What do we need to know now? What can we afford to know later?" This heavily iterative approach works because the game is constantly playable.

**Early Access as development partner.** Both Hades games used 18-24 month Early Access periods. Kasavin: "Sweet spot timing: far enough for meaningful feedback, early enough to act on it." For Shahnameh's episodic model, this suggests releasing Episode 1 early to refine mechanics before committing to full production.

**Content reuse through roguelike structure.** Players experience each asset dozens of times. Each enemy, boss, environment, and dialogue line delivers more value per development hour than linear games.

**Multi-hat team members.** With 25 people, Supergiant still expects employees to work "outside their core competency." Staff members voice characters, contribute design ideas, and cross-train.

**Proprietary tools matter.** Supergiant's custom C++ engine (evolved from XNA/C# origins) is optimized specifically for 2D isometric gameplay. They use "weird proprietary tools" tailored to their asset pipeline. **For Shahnameh:** investing early in custom tooling for repetitive tasks (dialogue integration, enemy spawning patterns, procedural level variants) pays compound dividends.

## Feasibility assessment for 2-person team with free AI tools

### Realistically adoptable from Hades II:

**Mythology adaptation framework.** Classical source research → tonal character stacking → creative modernization. Zero budget required; just research discipline.

**Combat feel principles.** Readable windups, hit feedback, combo preservation, accessibility options. Achievable in any engine with animation attention.

**Meta-progression psychology.** Permanent upgrades, relationship investments, voluntary difficulty scaling. Design patterns, not resource requirements.

**Single-person audio integration.** One person handling music/SFX/voice direction is proven viable at AAA quality.

**Iterative development.** Playable builds constantly; design through testing rather than documentation.

### Requires larger budget/team:

**30,000+ fully-voiced lines.** Even with AI voice synthesis, this scale requires years of writing and implementation.

**Hand-painted 2D art at Jen Zee quality.** Stable Diffusion can generate style-consistent assets, but achieving cohesive hand-crafted aesthetic requires significant art direction.

**4+ hours of dynamic music.** AudioCraft produces atmospheric content; composed character themes with live orchestral recording requires budget.

**25-person iteration bandwidth.** More testers = faster iteration cycles. 2 people can iterate, but more slowly.

### Specific AI tool applications:

**Stable Diffusion:** Character concept art iteration, environment mood boards, UI element generation. Won't match Jen Zee's hand-painted coherence but can establish visual direction efficiently.

**Blender:** Full 3D-to-2D sprite workflow (Supergiant renders 3D to sprite sequences for some animations). Free and capable of AAA-quality output with skill investment.

**AudioCraft:** Atmospheric music beds, ambient environmental audio, combat intensity stems. Layer with composed melodic themes for Persian instrument authenticity.

**Claude Code for development:** Dialogue systems, enemy behavior scripting, procedural generation logic, UI implementation. The 22,000 voice line system is largely systems engineering—achievable with AI coding assistance.

## Essential video resources for deeper study

**Noclip's "Developing Hell" documentary** (6 parts, 4 hours total) provides unprecedented access to Supergiant's 2-year Hades development journey. Watch Episode 3 specifically for Jen Zee's art direction process and Darren Korb's audio creation.

**GDC talk "Breathing Life into Greek Myth: The Dialogue of Hades"** (59 minutes) details how <20 employees produced 22,000+ voiced lines—essential for understanding scalable narrative systems.

**GDC Podcast Episode 16 with Greg Kasavin** covers studio philosophy, work-life balance, and creative direction thinking directly from Supergiant's leadership.

## Key takeaways for Shahnameh development

The gap between Supergiant's resources and a 2-person team is vast, but their design philosophy transcends budget:

1. **Mythology adaptation requires research discipline, not money.** Establish primary sources, define character tonality before design, modernize thoughtfully.

2. **Combat "feel" comes from deliberate constraints.** Readable windups, animation commitment, hit feedback, combo preservation—all achievable with attention rather than scale.

3. **Episodic structure can borrow meta-progression psychology.** Permanent unlocks, relationship investments, and voluntary challenge scaling maintain player investment across releases.

4. **Single-person audio leadership is validated.** Cultural instruments (Persian) + modern production creates distinctive soundscapes achievable with free tools plus targeted human recording.

5. **Iterate through playing, not documenting.** "The game is the design document" works at any team size.

6. **Release early to learn.** Episode 1 should ship before full commitment to later episodes—Early Access thinking without the label.

The ultimate lesson from Hades II: Supergiant's quality comes from 15 years of compounding skill development, not any single technique a competitor can copy. For Shahnameh, aim for their design principles and cultural authenticity approach while scoping ruthlessly to what 2 people with AI assistance can actually polish to completion.
