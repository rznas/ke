# Garshasp: Iran's pioneering Persian mythology game offers critical lessons

**The most expensive Iranian video game of its era teaches a blunt lesson: ambitious scope without matching resources produces mediocre results.** Dead Mage's Garshasp series (2011-2012)—built by a team that started with just 2 people and grew to 9—attempted to create a God of War-style action game based on Persian mythology, achieving cultural significance while earning a harsh **49/100 Metacritic score**. The studio's founder later admitted: "The result was a mediocre game, but it was very fun. We learned a lot." That learning propelled Dead Mage to later success with Children of Morta (1 million+ sales), making their Garshasp experience invaluable for any small team attempting Persian mythology games.

## Dead Mage started with two friends and a $500,000 budget

Dead Mage originated as **Fanafzar Sharif Studios** in Tehran, Iran, founded in 2006 when Amir Fassihi (programmer) and Cyrus (3D modeler) began development. The team grew incrementally: adding a concept artist and animator after a few months, spending 2 years on R&D and prototyping, then expanding to a **core team of 9 people** (3 programmers, 1 concept artist, 1 3D modeler, and support roles) by release. Some sources cite 20 total contributors including part-time members.

The combined budget for both Garshasp games reached approximately **$500,000 USD**—making it the most expensive Iranian video game at the time. Initial funding came from self-funded web development work, with later support from Iran's Ministry of Culture. International sanctions against Iran prevented licensing commercial game engines like Unity or Unreal, forcing the team to build a **custom engine from open-source components**: OGRE 3D for rendering, NVIDIA PhysX for physics, OpenAL for audio, and Boost C++ libraries. This technical constraint added significant development complexity but eliminated licensing costs.

**Release timeline:**
- **Garshasp: The Monster Slayer** — May 8-9, 2011 (Steam/GamersGate), priced at $19.99
- **Garshasp: Temple of the Dragon** — September 24, 2012 (standalone prequel expansion)
- Both PC-only; planned Xbox Live and Linux ports never materialized
- Current Steam price: $4.99 (historical low: $0.49)

The team ultimately **emigrated from Iran to Texas** to establish Dead Mage Inc. and access international distribution, highlighting the extreme challenges facing Iranian developers seeking global markets.

## Critical and user reception landed firmly in "ambitious but flawed" territory

**Garshasp: The Monster Slayer** achieved mixed reviews:
- **Metacritic: 49/100** (19 critic reviews: 1 positive, 11 mixed, 7 negative)
- **Steam: 49% positive** (235 reviews)
- IGN: 5.0/10 — "Less of everything that makes [God of War] cool"
- GameSpot: 5.0/10 — "Impressive feats for a $19.99 independent release... four-hour game that only partially makes good on its potential"

**Temple of the Dragon** fared worse with **25% positive Steam reviews** (77 reviews) and critics calling it "a revolting prequel to a disgusting game" (Absolute Games). The sequel suffered from fixed camera angles, worse voice acting, and only 1.5-2 hours of content.

### What players consistently praised

**Persian mythology as differentiation**: Reviewers universally praised the "rare opportunity to explore an alternative mythology" unfamiliar to Western audiences. The art design drawn from "ancient stone carvings found throughout Iran" earned consistent compliments even from negative reviews. One critic noted the games feature "beautiful ugly monsters" with "Persian kind of ornamentation."

**Ambitious indie achievement**: Rock Paper Shotgun acknowledged the team "obviously worked hard to get the game to this level." GameSpot called the production values "impressive feats for a $19.99 independent release." The cultural significance resonated deeply in Iran—one commenter stated: "If you haven't heard of Garshasp, then you don't know anything about the Iranian video game industry."

### What players consistently criticized

**Combat lacking impact**: The most damaging criticism targeted the floaty, unresponsive combat. Attacks sometimes passed through enemies without registering, and the first two blows of combos often failed to connect. Unlike God of War, players couldn't cancel animations to block or dodge. DarkZero's review captured the consensus: "Unpolished collision detection... sometimes you'll be doing a combo and the enemy does not react."

**Extremely short length**: At **3-4 hours** for Monster Slayer and **1.5-2 hours** for Temple of the Dragon, players felt shortchanged. A second weapon obtained in "the last 30 minutes" rendered progression systems meaningless. One reviewer exclaimed: "Wait, what?!! 3 hours?! Yes, it's like a sample of a game."

**Technical bugs and poor PC controls**: The camera "goes cockeyed and starts going into the scenery." Keyboard/mouse controls were described as "practically unplayable"—the game essentially required a gamepad. Checkpoint bugs, frame rate issues, and climbing glitches compounded frustration.

## Combat mechanics reveal the difficulty of matching AAA design with indie resources

Garshasp employed a **hack-and-slash combat system** clearly modeled on God of War, featuring light and heavy attacks, combo strings, a block/dodge system, grab finishers, and a rage meter for special moves. Weapons included a large scimitar, wrist-mounted blades for finishing moves, and a late-game Dragon Mace. An automated experience system upgraded weapons through red orbs collected from kills, unlocking new combos.

### Boss design showed ambition exceeding execution

Major bosses demonstrated the team's cinematic aspirations:
- **Huspa Forest Giant**: A colossus taller than trees, defeated by climbing up its body, hacking through knees, and stabbing its eye
- **Hitasp "The Golden Crown"**: The primary antagonist wielding an enormous sword, requiring pattern recognition and QTE execution
- **Temple Dragon**: Appears as a cliffhanger ending

These encounters attempted the scale of God of War's famous battles but suffered from camera problems and simpler QTE patterns. Combat arenas used a "kill enemies to open red barrier" structure that funneled players linearly through environments.

### The floaty combat problem

The fundamental combat feel never matched its inspiration. Reviewers consistently described attacks lacking "weight" and impact—enemies fell without satisfying feedback. The grab mechanic could be exploited to trivialize encounters. With only 2 weapons versus God of War's arsenal and no target lock-on system, depth remained shallow. Difficulty primarily came from frustrating platforming sections rather than satisfying combat challenges.

## Persian mythology integration showed research depth but inaccessible presentation

The developers explicitly drew from **authentic Persian sources**: the epic poem Garshasp-nama by Asadi Tusi (1066 CE), the Avesta (Zoroastrian scripture), and Shahnameh traditions. Most images and scenes were "based directly upon historical resources and ancient stone carvings found throughout Iran."

### Who is Garshasp in Persian mythology?

In Zoroastrian texts (Avestan: Kərəsāspa), Garshasp is a legendary monster-slayer who defeated the three-headed dragon Aži Sruvara—a creature so long he "ran along its back for half a day before killing it." He also slew Gandarəβa, a sea monster tall enough that deep ocean only reached its knee. In Shahnameh genealogy, Garshasp is the **ancestor of Rostam**, the greatest hero of Persian epic (Garshasp → Narēmān → Sām → Zāl → Rostam).

### Game narrative and setting

The game takes place years after the legendary hero Fereydun imprisoned **Azhi Dahaka (Zahhak)** in Mount Damavand. The Deevs—demons who served as commanders in Azhi Dahaka's "Army of Darkness"—have formed colonies throughout the land of **Khunirath**. The antagonist Hitasp "The Golden Crown" raids Siavoshgard (legendary home of Pahlavans/heroes), kills Garshasp's brother Oroxia, and steals the ancestral **Mace of Trinth**. Garshasp's revenge quest forms the narrative spine.

### Deev representation drew from Zoroastrian tradition

The Deevs (Avestan: daēuua, evolving to Persian dīv) represent beings created by Ahriman (the evil spirit) as antitheses to Ahura Mazda's divine beings. Traditional depictions show large, monstrous creatures with horns, sharp teeth, and claws—which the game faithfully adapted. The variety ranged from standard humanoid demons to giant boss-scale creatures.

### Accessibility became a critical weakness

Despite authentic sourcing, the narrative presentation failed most Western players. Critics noted it "mires too deep in forgotten lore to be interesting to anyone who doesn't already know what it's about." The heavy use of unfamiliar names—Siavoshgard, Khunirath, Faranbagh, Hara Berezaiti—without explanation made the story "hard to keep up." One Iranian reviewer lamented: "Rather than a careful exposition of Persian themes and stories we get a shambling mess." The lesson: **authenticity without accessibility squanders unique cultural IP**.

## Development challenges illuminate what small teams face

### The sanctions-forced technology stack

Unable to license Unity or Unreal Engine, the team built around open-source tools:
- **OGRE 3D Engine** for rendering (chosen because "it is not a full game engine"—they wanted control)
- **NVIDIA PhysX** for physics
- **OpenAL** for audio
- **WxWidgets** for their world editor
- **Particle Universe** for effects

This approach eliminated licensing costs and avoided sanctions complications but required building many systems from scratch since OGRE is only a rendering engine. The collision detection and camera problems that plagued reviews likely stemmed from custom system implementation rather than proven middleware.

### The 4-year development grind

Development began in early 2006, with the Iranian domestic release in November 2010 and international launch in May 2011. Amir Fassihi confirmed "we worked on it for four years" with 2 years spent on R&D and prototyping before content creation began. For a 3-4 hour game, this timeline reveals how much time small teams lose to learning and technical challenges rather than content production.

### Smart decisions and inevitable compromises

**What worked:**
- Using open-source tools eliminated costs and sanctions issues
- Self-funding through web development maintained independence
- Attending international conferences (Gamescom, GDC) generated exposure and learning
- The art book release with concept art and mythology backstory added marketing value
- Relocating to Texas to form Dead Mage Inc. enabled international distribution

**What was sacrificed:**
- Camera system was locked rather than fully controllable
- Combat depth limited to a fraction of God of War's systems
- Game length truncated to 3-4 hours
- No console versions despite original plans
- Collision detection and enemy reaction systems remained buggy

## The series ended with a crucial strategic pivot

Temple of the Dragon's poor reception (25% positive) and the team's recognition that their approach wasn't working led to a deliberate strategic shift. Amir Fassihi later reflected: **"We learned that, as an indie team, there are certain games that you have to focus on. You can't go and try to compete with the triple AAA out there."**

Rather than pursue a true Garshasp 2, Dead Mage pivoted to **Shadow Blade** (2014)—a mobile action platformer with scope appropriate to their team size. This succeeded on iOS and proved the lesson. They then spent 5 years developing **Children of Morta** (2019), a story-driven roguelike published by 11 bit studios that sold **over 1 million copies** and established Dead Mage as a respected indie studio. Their upcoming titles include Wizard of Legend 2 (2025) and Tale of Ronin.

The Garshasp series died not from failure but from wisdom: the team learned that **matching scope to resources matters more than ambition**.

## Eight actionable lessons for a 2-person team building Shahnameh: Legends of Persia

### 1. Scope ruthlessly—Garshasp's biggest mistake was dreaming too big

Fassihi stated bluntly: "Initially the biggest mistake any team with little experience makes is dreaming big and selecting a scope which is way, way, way bigger than what you can do." A 2-person team attempting a God of War clone failed after 4 years and $500,000. The lesson for a 2-person team: **design for what you can actually finish**, not what you wish you could make. Episodic releases are wise—each episode should be completable within realistic constraints.

### 2. Combat feel matters more than combat depth

The floaty, unresponsive combat destroyed Garshasp's core loop despite having combos, rage meters, and boss fights. God of War succeeds because every hit feels impactful. With limited resources, prioritize **weight and responsiveness** over feature count. A simple combat system that feels satisfying beats a complex one that feels hollow.

### 3. Make Persian mythology accessible, not just authentic

Garshasp researched extensively—Garshaspnama, Avesta, Shahnameh—but failed to translate that research into accessible narrative. Western players felt lost in unfamiliar names without context. **Build explanation into gameplay**: introduce terminology gradually, use visual storytelling, provide optional lore without requiring it for comprehension. The uniqueness of Persian mythology is your hook—don't bury it.

### 4. Length should match quality, not ambition

A polished 2-hour experience beats a buggy 4-hour one. Temple of the Dragon's 1.5-hour runtime wasn't inherently the problem—it was the poor quality and $5 price that created the perception of being cheated. **Price and communicate appropriately** for actual content. An episodic structure explicitly sets expectations for shorter segments.

### 5. Gamepad-first design for action games

Garshasp was "practically unplayable with keyboard/mouse." If designing a melee action game, assume controller input and treat keyboard as secondary. This is especially important for solo/small teams who can't afford to polish both input methods equally.

### 6. Your unique hook must compensate for production gaps

Fassihi noted indie games need "unique hooks" since they lack marketing budgets and must rely on word of mouth. Persian mythology was Garshasp's hook but wasn't leveraged strongly enough. For Shahnameh: Legends of Persia, the mythology isn't just flavor—it should be the primary differentiator that makes players overlook inevitable production limitations. **Lean into what makes you unique.**

### 7. Get external feedback early and continuously

After Garshasp, Dead Mage made "getting external feedback at every stage" critical to their process. Their later successes directly resulted from this lesson. For a 2-person team, this means playtesting relentlessly—combat feel, narrative clarity, and pacing all require outside perspectives to evaluate.

### 8. Consider Dead Mage's successful pivot as a template

Dead Mage went from a "mediocre" God of War clone to million-selling roguelikes by choosing genres where indie teams compete effectively. A 2-person team might consider whether pure action-adventure is the right genre, or whether incorporating elements of genres where small teams thrive (roguelikes, metroidvanias, narrative games) could make the project more achievable without abandoning the Persian mythology vision.

## Conclusion: Garshasp as cautionary tale and inspiration

The Garshasp series represents both a warning and a proof of concept. The warning: **a small team cannot out-AAA an AAA studio**, no matter how much ambition or cultural authenticity they bring. The proof: Persian mythology resonated with audiences even in a flawed package—the setting and aesthetic received praise even from reviewers who hated the gameplay.

For Shahnameh: Legends of Persia, the path forward lies not in emulating Garshasp's approach but in learning from its mistakes. The mythology is proven compelling. The audience exists. The execution must match reality: tight scope, polished feel over feature count, accessible storytelling, and genre choices that let a 2-person team compete. Dead Mage's evolution from Garshasp to Children of Morta shows the trajectory—they didn't abandon their craft, they found where their resources could create excellence rather than mediocrity.

The most valuable thing Garshasp offers isn't a template to copy but a failure mode to avoid: **ambition untethered from capacity produces games that are impressive for their circumstances but unsatisfying as experiences**. A 2-person team with AI assistance and free tools has different constraints than a 9-person team with $500,000 in 2006 Iran—but the core lesson transcends context. Build what you can finish. Polish what you build. Let the mythology carry the weight that production values cannot.
